Downey , Jeﬀ Elkner, and others.\\nIn December of 2009, I was preparing to teachSI502 - Networked Programming at\\nthe University of Michigan for the ﬁfth semester in a row and decided it was time to\\nwrite a Python textbook that focused on exploring data instead of understanding\\nalgorithms and abstractions. My goal in SI502 is to teach people lifelong data\\nhandling skills using Python. F ew of my students were planning to be professional\\ncomputer programmers. Instead, they planned to be librarians, managers, lawyers,\\nbiologists, economists, etc., who happened to want to skillfully use technology in\\ntheir chosen ﬁeld.\\nI never seemed to ﬁnd the perfect data-oriented Python book for my course, so I\\nset out to write just such a book. Luckily at a faculty meeting three weeks before\\nI was about to start my new book from scratch over the holiday break, Dr. At ul\\nPrakash showed me the Think Python book which he had used to teach his Python\\ncourse that semester. It is a well-written Computer Science text with a focus on\\nshort, direct explanations and ease of learning.\\nThe overall book structure has been changed to get to doing data analysis problems\\nas quickly as possible and have a series of running examples and exercises about\\ndata analysis from the very beginning.\\nChapters 2–10 are similar to theThink Python book, but there have been major\\nchanges. Number-oriented examples and exercises have been replaced with data-\\noriented exercises. T opics are presented in the order needed to build increasingly\\nsophisticated data analysis solutions. Some topics liketry and except are pulled\\nforward and presented as part of the chapter on conditionals. F unctions are given\\nvery light treatment until they are needed to handle program complexity rather\\nthan introduced as an early lesson in abstraction. Nearly all user-deﬁned functions\\nhave been removed from the example code and exercises outside of Chapter 4. The\\nword “recursion”\\n1 does not appear in the book at all.\\nIn chapters 1 and 11–16, all of the material is brand new, focusing on real-worl d\\nuses and simple examples of Python for data analysis including regular expressions\\nfor searching and parsing, automating tasks on your computer, retrieving data\\nacross the network, scraping web pages for data, object-oriented programming,\\nusing web services, parsing XML and JSON data, creating and using databases\\nusing Structured Query Language, and visualizing data.\\nThe ultimate goal of all of these changes is to shift from a Computer Science to an\\nInformatics focus and to only include topics into a ﬁrst technology class that can\\nbe useful even if one chooses not to become a professional programmer.\\n1 Except, of course, for this line.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 3, 'page_label': 'iv'}, page_content='iv\\nStudents who ﬁnd this book interesting and want to further explore should look\\nat Allen B. Downey’sThink Python book. Because there is a lot of overlap be-\\ntween the two books, students will quickly pick up skills in the additional a reas of\\ntechnical programming and algorithmic thinking that are covered in Think Python .\\nAnd given that the books have a similar writing style, they should be able to move\\nquickly through Think Python with a minimum of eﬀort.\\nAs the copyright holder of Think Python , Allen has given me permission to change\\nthe book’s license on the material from his book that remains in this book f rom the\\nGNU F ree Documentation License to the more recent Creative Commons Attribu-\\ntion — Share Alike license. This follows a general shift in open documentation\\nlicenses moving from the GFDL to the CC-BY-SA (e.g., Wikipedia). Using the\\nCC-BY-SA license maintains the book’s strong copyleft tradition while making it\\neven more straightforward for new authors to reuse this material as they see ﬁt.\\nI feel that this book serves as an example of why open materials are so impo rtant\\nto the future of education, and I want to thank Allen B. Downey and Cambridge\\nUniversity Press for their forward-looking decision to make the book available\\nunder an open copyright. I hope they are pleased with the results of my eﬀorts\\nand I hope that you, the reader, are pleased withour collective eﬀorts.\\nI would like to thank Allen B. Downey and Lauren Cowles for their help, patience,\\nand guidance in dealing with and resolving the copyright issues around this book.\\nCharles Severance\\nwww.dr-chuck.com\\nAnn Arbor, MI,

Y ou\\ncan write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving\\na diﬃcult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a\\nproblem. This book assumes thateveryone needs to know how to program, and\\nthat once you know how to program you will ﬁgure out what you want to do with\\nyour newfound skills.\\nW e are surrounded in our daily lives with computers ranging from laptops to cell\\nphones. W e can think of these computers as our “personal assistants” who can take\\ncare of many things on our behalf. The hardware in our current-day computers is\\nessentially built to continuously ask us the question, “What would you like me to\\ndo next?”\\nProgrammers add an operating system and a set of applications to the hardware\\nand we end up with a Personal Digital Assistant that is quite helpful and capable\\nof helping us do many diﬀerent things.\\nOur computers are fast and have vast amounts of memory and could be very helpful\\nto us if we only knew the language to speak to explain to the computer what we\\nwould like it to “do next” . If we knew this language, we could tell the computer\\nto do tasks on our behalf that were repetitive. Interestingly , the kinds of thing s\\ncomputers can do best are often the kinds of things that we humans ﬁnd boring\\nand mind-numbing.\\nWhat \\nNext? \\nWhat \\nNext? \\nWhat \\nNext? \\nWhat \\nNext? \\nWhat \\nNext? \\nWhat \\nNext? \\nFigure 1.1: Personal Digital Assistant\\n1'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 13, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content='2 CHAPTER 1.

While you were\\nable to read and understand the words in a few seconds, counting them is almost\\npainful because it is not the kind of problem that human minds are designed to\\nsolve. F or a computer, the opposite is true, reading and understanding text from\\na piece of paper is hard for a computer to do but counting the words and telling\\nyou how many times the most used word was used is very easy for the computer:\\npython words.py\\nEnter file: words.txt\\nto\\n16\\nOur “personal information analysis assistant” quickly told us that the word “to”\\nwas used sixteen times in the ﬁrst three paragraphs of this chapter.\\nThis very fact that computers are good at things that humans are not is why you\\nneed to become skilled at talking “computer language” . Once you learn this new\\nlanguage, you can delegate mundane tasks to your partner (the computer), leaving\\nmore time for you to do the things that you are uniquely suited for. Y ou bring\\ncreativity , intuition, and inventiveness to this partnership.\\n1.1 Creativity and motivation\\nWhile this book is not intended for professional programmers, professional pr o-\\ngramming can be a very rewarding job both ﬁnancially and personally . Building\\nuseful, elegant, and clever programs for others to use is a very creative activity .\\nY our computer or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) usually contains many dif-\\nferent programs from many diﬀerent groups of programmers, each competing fo r\\nyour attention and interest. They try their best to meet your needs and give you a\\ngreat user experience in the process. In some situations, when you choose a piece\\nof software, the programmers are directly compensated because of your choice.\\nIf we think of programs as the creative output of groups of programmers, perhaps\\nthe following ﬁgure is a more sensible version of our PDA:\\nF or now, our primary motivation is not to make money or please end users, but\\ninstead for us to be more productive in handling the data and information that we\\nwill encounter in our lives. When you ﬁrst start, you will be both the progra mmer\\nand the end user of your programs. As you gain skill as a programmer and pro-\\ngramming feels more creative to you, your thoughts may turn toward developing\\nprograms for others.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 14, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content='1.2.

If you were to take apart your computer or cell phone and look deep inside,\\nyou would ﬁnd the following parts:\\nThe high-level deﬁnitions of these parts are as follows:\\n• The Central Processing Unit (or CPU) is the part of the computer that is\\nbuilt to be obsessed with “what is next?” If your computer is rated at 3.0\\nGigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask “What next?” three billion times\\nper second. Y ou are going to have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with\\nthe CPU.\\n• The Main Memory is used to store information that the CPU needs in a\\nhurry . The main memory is nearly as fast as the CPU. But the information\\nstored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned oﬀ.\\n• The Secondary Memory is also used to store information, but it is much\\nslower than the main memory . The advantage of the secondary memory is\\nthat it can store information even when there is no power to the computer.\\nExamples of secondary memory are disk drives or ﬂash memory (typically\\nfound in USB sticks and portable music players).\\n• The Input and Output Devices are simply our screen, keyboard, mouse, mi-\\ncrophone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all of the ways we interact with\\nthe computer.\\n• These days, most computers also have a Network Connection to retrieve\\ninformation over a network. W e can think of the network as a very slow\\nplace to store and retrieve data that might not always be “up” . So in a sense,\\nthe network is a slower and at times unreliable form ofSecondary Memory .\\nWhile most of the detail of how these components work is best left to computer\\nbuilders, it helps to have some terminology so we can talk about these diﬀerent\\nparts as we write our programs.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 15, 'page_label': '10'}, page_content='4 CHAPTER 1. WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS?\\nInput and \\nOutput \\nDevices \\nSoftware \\nMain \\nMemory \\nCentral \\nProcessing \\nUnit \\nWhat \\nNext? \\nNetwork \\nSecondary \\nMemory \\nFigure 1.4: Where Are Y ou?\\nAs a programmer, your job is to use and orchestrate each of these resources to\\nsolve the problem that you need to solve and analyze the data you get from the\\nsolution. As a programmer you will mostly be “talking” to the CPU and t elling\\nit what to do next. Sometimes you will tell the CPU to use the main memory ,\\nsecondary memory , network, or the input/output devices.\\nY ou need to be the person who answers the CPU’s “What next?” question. But it\\nwould be very uncomfortable to shrink you down to 5mm tall and insert you int o\\nthe computer just so you could issue a command three billion times per second. So\\ninstead, you must write down your instructions in advance. W e call these stored\\ninstructions a program and the act of writing these instructions down and getting\\nthe instructions to be correct programming .\\n1.3 Understanding programming\\nIn the rest of this book, we will try to turn you into a person who is ski lled in the art\\nof programming. In the end you will be a programmer - perhaps not a professional\\nprogrammer, but at least you will have the skills to look at a data/infor mation\\nanalysis problem and develop a program to solve the problem.\\nIn a sense, you need two skills to be a programmer:\\n• First, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need to\\nknow the vocabulary and the grammar. Y ou need to be able to spell the\\nwords in this new language properly and know how to construct well-formed\\n“sentences” in this new language.\\n• Second, you need to “tell a story” . In writing a story , you combine words\\nand sentences to convey an idea to the reader. There is a skill and art in\\nconstructing the story , and skill in story writing is improved by doing som e\\nwriting and getting some feedback. In programming, our program is the\\n“story” and the problem you are trying to solve is the “idea” .\\nOnce you learn one programming language such as Python, you will ﬁnd it much\\neasier to learn a second programming language such as JavaScript or C++.

WORDS AND SENTENCES 5\\nnew programming language has very diﬀerent vocabulary and grammar but the\\nproblem-solving skills will be the same across all programming languages.\\nY ou will learn the “vocabulary” and “sentences” of Python pretty quickly . It w ill\\ntake longer for you to be able to write a coherent program to solve a brand-new\\nproblem. W e teach programming much like we teach writing. W e start reading\\nand explaining programs, then we write simple programs, and then we write in-\\ncreasingly complex programs over time. At some point you “get your muse” and\\nsee the patterns on your own and can see more naturally how to take a problem\\nand write a program that solves that problem. And once you get to that point,\\nprogramming becomes a very pleasant and creative process.\\nW e start with the vocabulary and structure of Python programs. Be patient a s\\nthe simple examples remind you of when you started reading for the ﬁrst time.\\n1.4 W ords and sentences\\nUnlike human languages, the Python vocabulary is actually pretty small. W e call\\nthis “vocabulary” the “reserved words” or “keywords” . These are words that hav e\\nvery special meaning to Python. When Python sees these words in a Python\\nprogram, they have one and only one meaning to Python. Later as you write\\nprograms you will make up your own words that have meaning to you called\\nvariables. Y ou will have great latitude in choosing your names for your variables,\\nbut you cannot use any of Python’s reserved words as a name for a variable.\\nWhen we train a dog, we use special words like “sit”, “stay”, and “fetch” . When\\nyou talk to a dog and don’t use any of the reserved words, they just look at you\\nwith a quizzical look on their face until you say a reserved word. F or example, i f\\nyou say , “I wish more people would walk to improve their overall health”, what\\nmost dogs likely hear is, “blah blah blah walk blah blah blah blah. ” That is because\\n“walk” is a reserved word in dog language. Many might suggest that the langua ge\\nbetween humans and cats has no reserved words\\n1 .\\nThe reserved words in the language where humans talk to Python include the\\nfollowing:\\nFalse await else import pass\\nNone break except in raise\\nTrue class finally is return\\nand continue for lambda try\\nas def from nonlocal while\\nassert del global not with\\nasync elif if or yield\\nThat is it, and unlike a dog, Python is already completely trained. When you say\\n“try”, Python will try every time you say it without fail.\\nW e will learn these reserved words and how they are used in good time, but for\\nnow we will focus on the Python equivalent of “speak” (in human-to-dog language) .\\nThe nice thing about telling Python to speak is that we can even tell it what to\\nsay by giving it a message in quotes:\\n1 http://xkcd.com/231/'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 17, 'page_label': '12'}, page_content='6 CHAPTER 1. WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS?\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Hello world!/quotesingle.ts1)\\nAnd we have even written our ﬁrst syntactically correct Python sentence. Our\\nsentence starts with the function print followed by a string of text of our choosing\\nenclosed in single quotes. The strings in the print statements are enclosed in quo tes.\\nSingle quotes and double quotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes\\nexcept in cases where a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the\\nstring.\\n1.5 Conversing with Python\\nNow that we have a word and a simple sentence that we know in Python, we need\\nto know how to start a conversation with Python to test our new language skills.\\nBefore you can converse with Python, you must ﬁrst install the Python soft ware\\non your computer and learn how to start Python on your computer. That is too\\nmuch detail for this chapter so I suggest that you consult\\nwww.py4e.com where\\nI have detailed instructions and screencasts of setting up and starting Python on\\nMacintosh and Windows systems. At some point, you will be in a terminal or\\ncommand window and you will type python and the Python interpreter will start\\nexecuting in interactive mode and appear somewhat as follows:\\nPython\\n3.11.6 (main, Nov 2 2023 , 04: 39:43)\\n[Clang 14.0.3 (clang-1403.0.22.14.1)] on darwin\\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more\\ninformation.\\n>>>\\nThe >>> prompt is the Python interpreter’s way of asking you, “What do you want\\nme to do next?” Python is ready to have a conversation with you. All you have\\nto know is how to speak the Python language.\\nLet’s say for example that you did not know even the simplest Python language\\nwords or sentences. Y ou might want to use the standard line that astronauts use\\nwhen they land on a faraway planet and try to speak with the inhabitants of the\\nplanet:\\n>>> I come in peace, please take me to your leader\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\\nI come in peace take me tou your leader\\nˆˆˆˆ\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n>>>\\nThis is not going so well. Unless you think of something quickly , the inhabitant s\\nof the planet are likely to stab you with their spears, put you on a spit, roa st you\\nover a ﬁre, and eat you for dinner.\\nLuckily you brought a copy of this book on your travels, and you thumb to this\\nvery page and try again:'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 18, 'page_label': '13'}, page_content='1.5. CONVERSING WITH PYTHON 7\\n>>> print(/quotesingle.ts1Hello world!/quotesingle.ts1)\\nHello world !\\nThis is looking much better, so you try to communicate some more:\\n>>> print(/quotesingle.ts1You must be the legendary god that comes from the sky/quotesingle.ts1)\\nYou must be the legendary god that comes from the sky\\n>>> print(/quotesingle.ts1We have been waiting for you for a long time/quotesingle.ts1)\\nWe have been waiting for you for a long time\\n>>> print(/quotesingle.ts1Our legend says you will be very tasty with mustard/quotesingle.ts1)\\nOur legend says you will be very tasty with mustard\\n>>> print /quotesingle.ts1We will have a feast tonight unless you say\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\\nprint /quotesingle.ts1We will have a feast tonight unless you say\\nˆ\\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\\n>>>\\nThe conversation was going so well for a while and then you made the tiniest\\nmistake using the Python language and Python brought the spears back out.\\nAt this point, you should also realize that while Python is amazingly compl ex and\\npowerful and very picky about the syntax you use to communicate with it, Pyt hon\\nis not intelligent. Y ou are really just having a conversation with yourself, but using\\nproper syntax.\\nIn a sense, when you use a program written by someone else the conversation is\\nbetween you and those other programmers with Python acting as an intermediary.\\nPython is a way for the creators of programs to express how the conversation is\\nsupposed to proceed. And in just a few more chapters, you will be one of those\\nprogrammers using Python to talk to the users of your program.\\nBefore we leave our ﬁrst conversation with the Python interpreter, you should prob-\\nably know the proper way to say “good-bye” when interacting with the inhabitants\\nof Planet Python:\\n>>> good-bye\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nNameError: name /quotesingle.ts1good/quotesingle.ts1is not defined\\n>>> if you don /quotesingle.ts1t mind, I need to leave\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\\nif you don/quotesingle.ts1t mind, I need to leave\\nˆ\\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\\n>>> quit()\\nY ou will notice that the error is diﬀerent for the ﬁrst two incorrect attempts.

WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS?\\nThe proper way to say “good-bye” to Python is to enter quit() at the interactive\\nchevron >>> prompt. It would have probably taken you quite a while to guess that\\none, so having a book handy probably will turn out to be helpful.\\n1.6 T erminology: Interpreter and compiler\\nPython is ahigh-level language intended to be relatively straightforward for hu-\\nmans to read and write and for computers to read and process. Other high-level\\nlanguages include Java, C++, PHP , Ruby , Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more.\\nThe actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not under-\\nstand any of these high-level languages.\\nThe CPU understands a language we call machine language . Machine language is\\nvery simple and frankly very tiresome to write because it is represented all i n zeros\\nand ones:\\n001010001110100100101010000001111\\n11100110000011101010010101101101\\n...\\nMachine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros\\nand ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more intricate than Python.\\nSo very few programmers ever write machine language. Instead we build various\\ntranslators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like Python or\\nJavaScript and these translators convert the programs to machine language fo r\\nactual execution by the CPU.\\nSince machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not\\nportableacross diﬀerent types of hardware. Programs written in high-level lan-\\nguages can be moved between diﬀerent computers by using a diﬀerent interpreter\\non the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version\\nof the program for the new machine.\\nThese programming language translators fall into two general categories: (1) inter-\\npreters and (2) compilers.\\nAn interpreter reads the source code of the program as written by the programmer,\\nparses the source code, and interprets the instructions on the ﬂy . Python is an\\ninterpreter and when we are running Python interactively , we can type a line of\\nPython (a sentence) and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to\\ntype another line of Python.\\nSome of the lines of Python tell Python that you want it to remember some value\\nfor later. W e need to pick a name for that value to be remembered and we can use\\nthat symbolic name to retrieve the value later. W e use the termvariable to refer\\nto the labels we use to refer to this stored data.\\n>>> x = 6\\n>>> print(x)\\n6\\n>>> y = x * 7'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 20, 'page_label': '15'}, page_content='1.6. TERMINOLOGY: INTERPRETER AND COMPILER 9\\n>>> print(y)\\n42\\n>>>\\nIn this example, we ask Python to remember the value six and use the label x so\\nwe can retrieve the value later. W e verify that Python has actually remembered\\nthe value using print. Then we ask Python to retrieve x and multiply it by seven\\nand put the newly computed value in y. Then we ask Python to print out the\\nvalue currently in y.\\nEven though we are typing these commands into Python one line at a time, Python\\nis treating them as an ordered sequence of statements with later statements able\\nto retrieve data created in earlier statements. W e are writing our ﬁrst simple\\nparagraph with four sentences in a logical and meaningful order.\\nIt is the nature of aninterpreter to be able to have an interactive conversation\\nas shown above. A compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a ﬁle,\\nand then it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine\\nlanguage and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a ﬁle for\\nlater execution.\\nIf you have a Windows system, often these executable machine language programs\\nhave a suﬃx of “ .exe” or “ .dll” which stand for “executable” and “dynamic link\\nlibrary” respectively . In Linux and Macintosh, there is no suﬃx that uniquely\\nmarks a ﬁle as executable.\\nIf you were to open an executable ﬁle in a text editor, it would look completely\\ncrazy and be unreadable:\\n^?ELF^A^A^A^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^B^@^C^@^A^@^@^@\\\\xa0\\\\x82\\n^D^H4^@^@^@\\\\x90^]^@^@^@^@^@^@4^@ ^@^G^@(^@$^@!^@^F^@\\n^@^@4^@^@^@4\\\\x80^D^H4\\\\x80^D^H\\\\xe0^@^@^@\\\\xe0^@^@^@^E\\n^@^@^@^D^@^@^@^C^@^@^@^T^A^@^@^T\\\\x81^D^H^T\\\\x81^D^H^S\\n^@^@^@^S^@^@^@^D^@^@^@^A^@^@^@^A\\\\^D^HQVhT\\\\x83^D^H\\\\xe8\\n....\\nIt is not easy to read or write machine language, so it is nice that we haveinter-\\npreters and compilers that allow us to write in high-level languages like Python or\\nC.\\nNow at this point in our discussion of compilers and interpreters, you should b e\\nwondering a bit about the Python interpreter itself. What language is it written\\nin? Is it written in a compiled language? When we type “python”, what exactly\\nis happening?\\nThe Python interpreter is written in a high-level language called “C” . Y ou can lo ok\\nat the actual source code for the Python interpreter by going to\\nwww.python.org\\nand working your way to their source code. So Python is a program itself and it\\nis compiled into machine code. When you installed Python on your computer (or\\nthe vendor installed it), you copied a machine-code copy of the translated Python\\nprogram onto your system.

WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS?\\nThat is more than you really need to know to be a Python programmer, but\\nsometimes it pays to answer those little nagging questions right at the begi nning.\\n1.7 W riting a program\\nTyping commands into the Python interpreter is a great way to experiment with\\nPython’s features, but it is not recommended for solving more complex problems.\\nWhen we want to write a program, we use a text editor to write the Python\\ninstructions into a ﬁle, which is called a script. By convention, Python scripts\\nhave names that end with .py.\\nT o execute the script, you have to tell the Python interpreter the name of the ﬁle.\\nIn a command window, you would type python hello.py as follows:\\n$ cat hello.py\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Hello world!/quotesingle.ts1)\\n$ python hello.py\\nHello world!\\nThe “$” is the operating system prompt, and the “cat hello.py” is showing us that\\nthe ﬁle “hello.py” has a one-line Python program to print a string.\\nW e call the Python interpreter and tell it to read its source code from the ﬁle\\n“hello.py” instead of prompting us for lines of Python code interactively .\\nY ou will notice that there was no need to have quit() at the end of the Python\\nprogram in the ﬁle. When Python is reading your source code from a ﬁle, it knows\\nto stop when it reaches the end of the ﬁle.\\n1.8 What is a program?\\nThe deﬁnition of a program at its most basic is a sequence of Python statements\\nthat have been crafted to do something. Even our simple hel lo.py script is a\\nprogram. It is a one-line program and is not particularly useful, but in the strict est\\ndeﬁnition, it is a Python program.\\nIt might be easiest to understand what a program is by thinking about a problem\\nthat a program might be built to solve, and then looking at a program that would\\nsolve that problem.\\nLets say you are doing Social Computing research on F acebook posts and you are\\ninterested in the most frequently used word in a series of posts. Y ou could pri nt out\\nthe stream of F acebook posts and pore over the text looking for the most com mon\\nword, but that would take a long time and be very mistake prone. Y ou would be\\nsmart to write a Python program to handle the task quickly and accurately so you\\ncan spend the weekend doing something fun.\\nF or example, look at the following text about a clown and a car. Look at the text\\nand ﬁgure out the most common word and how many times it occurs.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 22, 'page_label': '17'}, page_content='1.9. THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PROGRAMS 11\\nthe clown ran after the car and the car ran into the tent\\nand the tent fell down on the clown and the car\\nThen imagine that you are doing this task looking at millions of lines of tex t.\\nF rankly it would be quicker for you to learn Python and write a Python pro gram\\nto count the words than it would be to manually scan the words.\\nThe even better news is that I already came up with a simple program to ﬁnd the\\nmost common word in a text ﬁle. I wrote it, tested it, and now I am giving it to\\nyou to use so you can save some time.\\nname\\n= input(/quotesingle.ts1Enter file: /quotesingle.ts1)\\nhandle = open(name, /quotesingle.ts1r/quotesingle.ts1)\\ncounts = dict()\\nfor line in handle:\\nwords = line.split()\\nfor word in words:\\ncounts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1\\nbigcount = None\\nbigword = None\\nfor word, count in list(counts.items()):\\nif bigcount is None or count > bigcount:\\nbigword = word\\nbigcount = count\\nprint(bigword, bigcount)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/words.py\\nY ou don’t even need to know Python to use this program. Y ou will need to\\nget through Chapter 10 of this book to fully understand the awesome Python\\ntechniques that were used to make the program. Y ou are the end user, you simply\\nuse the program and marvel at its cleverness and how it saved you so much manual\\neﬀort. Y ou simply type the code into a ﬁle calledwords.py and run it or you\\ndownload the source code from\\nhttp://www.py4e.com/code3/ and run it.\\nThis is a good example of how Python and the Python language are acting as an\\nintermediary between you (the end user) and me (the programmer). Python is a\\nway for us to exchange useful instruction sequences (i.e., programs) in a common\\nlanguage that can be used by anyone who installs Python on their computer. So\\nneither of us are talkingto Python , instead we are communicating with each other\\nthrough Python.\\n1.9 The building blocks of programs\\nIn the next few chapters, we will learn more about the vocabulary , sentence struc-\\nture, paragraph structure, and story structure of Python.

WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS?\\npowerful capabilities of Python and how to compose those capabilities together t o\\ncreate useful programs.\\nThere are some low-level conceptual patterns that we use to construct programs.\\nThese constructs are not just for Python programs, they are part of every program-\\nming language from machine language up to the high-level languages.\\ninputGet data from the “outside world” . This might be reading data from a\\nﬁle, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our initial\\nprograms, our input will come from the user typing data on the keyboard.\\noutput Display the results of the program on a screen or store them in a ﬁle or\\nperhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music or speak text.\\nsequential execution Perform statements one after another in the order they\\nare encountered in the script.\\nconditional execution Check for certain conditions and then execute or skip a\\nsequence of statements.\\nrepeated execution Perform some set of statements repeatedly , usually with\\nsome variation.\\nreuse W rite a set of instructions once and give them a name and then reuse those\\ninstructions as needed throughout your program.\\nIt sounds almost too simple to be true, and of course it is never so simple. It is like\\nsaying that walking is simply “putting one foot in front of the other” . The “ art” of\\nwriting a program is composing and weaving these basic elements together many\\ntimes over to produce something that is useful to its users.\\nThe word counting program above directly uses all of these patterns except for\\none.\\n1.10 What could possibly go wrong?\\nAs we saw in our earliest conversations with Python, we must communicate very\\nprecisely when we write Python code. The smallest deviation or mistake will ca use\\nPython to give up looking at your program.\\nBeginning programmers often take the fact that Python leaves no room for errors\\nas evidence that Python is mean, hateful, and cruel. While Python seems to like\\neveryone else, Python knows them personally and holds a grudge against them.\\nBecause of this grudge, Python takes our perfectly written programs and rejects\\nthem as “unﬁt” just to torment us.\\n>>> primt /quotesingle.ts1Hello world!/quotesingle.ts1\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\\nprimt /quotesingle.ts1Hello world!/quotesingle.ts1\\nˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆ\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n>>> primt ( /quotesingle.ts1Hello world/quotesingle.ts1)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 24, 'page_label': '19'}, page_content='1.10. WHA T COULD POSSIBL Y GO WRONG? 13\\nNameError: name /quotesingle.ts1primt/quotesingle.ts1is not defined. Did you mean: /quotesingle.ts1print/quotesingle.ts1?\\n>>> I hate you Python !\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\\nI hate you Python !\\nˆˆˆˆ\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n>>> if you come out of there, I would teach you a lesson\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\\nif you come out of there, I would teach you a lesson\\nˆˆˆˆ\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n>>>\\nThere is little to be gained by arguing with Python. It is just a tool. It ha s no\\nemotions and it is happy and ready to serve you whenever you need it. Its error\\nmessages sound harsh, but they are just Python’s call for help. It has looked at\\nwhat you typed, and it simply cannot understand what you have entered.\\nPython is much more like a dog, loving you unconditionally , having a few key wo rds\\nthat it understands, looking you with a sweet look on its face ( >>>), and waiting\\nfor you to say something it understands. When Python says “SyntaxError: inv alid\\nsyntax”, it is simply wagging its tail and saying, “Y ou seemed to say s omething\\nbut I just don’t understand what you meant, but please keep talking to me ( >>>). ”\\nAs your programs become increasingly sophisticated, you will encounter three gen-\\neral types of errors:\\nSyntax errorsThese are the ﬁrst errors you will make and the easiest to ﬁx. A\\nsyntax error means that you have violated the “grammar” rules of Python.\\nPython does its best to point right at the line and character where it noticed\\nit was confused. The only tricky bit of syntax errors is that sometimes the\\nmistake that needs ﬁxing is actually earlier in the program than where Python\\nnoticed it was confused. So the line and character that Python indicates in\\na syntax error may just be a starting point for your investigation.\\nLogic errors A logic error is when your program has good syntax but there is\\na mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how the\\nstatements relate to one another. A good example of a logic error might be,\\n“take a drink from your water bottle, put it in your backpack, walk to the\\nlibrary , and then put the top back on the bottle. ”\\nSemantic errors A semantic error is when your description of the steps to take is\\nsyntactically perfect and in the right order, but there is simply a mistake in\\nthe program. The program is perfectly correct but it does not do what you\\nintended for it to do. A simple example would be if you were giving a person\\ndirections to a restaurant and said, “. . . when you reach the intersection with\\nthe gas station, turn left and go one mile and the restaurant is a red building\\non your left. ” Y our friend is very late and calls you to tell you that they are\\non a farm and walking around behind a barn, with no sign of a restaurant.\\nThen you say “did you turn left or right at the gas station?” and they say , “ I\\nfollowed your directions perfectly , I have them written down, it says turn left\\nand go one mile at the gas station. ” Then you say , “I am very sorry , because'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 25, 'page_label': '20'}, page_content='14 CHAPTER 1. WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS?\\nwhile my instructions were syntactically correct, they sadly contained a small\\nbut undetected semantic error. ” .\\nAgain in all three types of errors, Python is merely trying its hardest to do exactly\\nwhat you have asked.\\n1.11 Debugging\\nWhen Python spits out an error or even when it gives you a result that is diﬀerent\\nfrom what you had intended, then begins the hunt for the cause of the error.\\nDebugging is the process of ﬁnding the cause of the error in your code. When you\\nare debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug, there\\nare four things to try:\\nreadingExamine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what\\nyou meant to say .\\nrunning Experiment by making changes and running diﬀerent versions. Often\\nif you display the right thing at the right place in the program, the prob-\\nlem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to spend some time to build\\nscaﬀolding.\\nruminating T ake some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime,\\nsemantic? What information can you get from the error messages, or from\\nthe output of the program? What kind of error could cause the problem\\nyou’re seeing? What did you change last, before the problem appeared?\\nretreating At some point, the best thing to do is back oﬀ, undoing recent changes,\\nuntil you get back to a program that works and that you understand. Then\\nyou can start rebuilding.\\nBeginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and forget\\nthe others. Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and some-\\ntimes retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others.Each\\nactivity comes with its own failure mode.\\nF or example, reading your code might help if the problem is a typographical error,\\nbut not if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. If you don’t understand\\nwhat your program does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because\\nthe error is in your head.\\nRunning experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if\\nyou run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into\\na pattern I call “random walk programming”, which is the process of making\\nrandom changes until the program does the right thing. Needless to say , random\\nwalk programming can take a long time.\\nY ou have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. Y ou\\nshould have at least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two o r\\nmore possibilities, try to think of a test that would eliminate one of them.\\nT aking a break helps with the thinking. So does talking. If you explain the problem\\nto someone else (or even to yourself), you will sometimes ﬁnd the answer before\\nyou ﬁnish asking the question.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 26, 'page_label': '21'}, page_content='1.12. THE LEARNING JOURNEY 15\\nBut even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or\\nif the code you are trying to ﬁx is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best\\noption is to retreat, simplifying the program until you get to something that works\\nand that you understand.\\nBeginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can’t stand to\\ndelete a line of code (even if it’s wrong). If it makes you feel better, copy your\\nprogram into another ﬁle before you start stripping it down. Then you can paste\\nthe pieces back in a little bit at a time.\\n1.12 The learning journey\\nAs you progress through the rest of the book, don’t be afraid if the concepts don’t\\nseem to ﬁt together well the ﬁrst time. When you were learning to speak, it was\\nnot a problem for your ﬁrst few years that you just made cute gurgling noises.\\nAnd it was OK if it took six months for you to move from simple vocabular y to\\nsimple sentences and took 5-6 more years to move from sentences to paragraphs,\\nand a few more years to be able to write an interesting complete short storyon\\nyour own.\\nW e want you to learn Python much more rapidly , so we teach it all at the s ame time\\nover the next few chapters. But it is like learning a new language that takes time to\\nabsorb and understand before it feels natural. That leads to some confusion as we\\nvisit and revisit topics to try to get you to see the big picture while we are deﬁni ng\\nthe tiny fragments that make up that big picture. While the book is written\\nlinearly , and if you are taking a course it will progress in a linear fashion, don’t\\nhesitate to be very nonlinear in how you approach the material. Look forwar ds\\nand backwards and read with a light touch. By skimming more advanced materia l\\nwithout fully understanding the details, you can get a better understanding of the\\n“why?” of programming. By reviewing previous material and even redoing earlier\\nexercises, you will realize that you actually learned a lot of material even if the\\nmaterial you are currently staring at seems a bit impenetrable.\\nUsually when you are learning your ﬁrst programming language, there are a few\\nwonderful “Ah Hah!” moments where you can look up from pounding away at\\nsome rock with a hammer and chisel and step away and see that you are indeed\\nbuilding a beautiful sculpture.\\nIf something seems particularly hard, there is usually no value in staying up all\\nnight and staring at it. T ake a break, take a nap, have a snack, explain what you\\nare having a problem with to someone (or perhaps your dog), and then come back\\nto it with fresh eyes. I assure you that once you learn the programming concepts\\nin the book you will look back and see that it was all really easy and elegant and\\nit simply took you a bit of time to absorb it.\\n1.13 Glossary\\nbugAn error in a program.\\ncentral processing unit The heart of any computer.

This is not a legal integer in Pyt hon, but it\\nis legal:\\n>>> print(1,000,000)\\n1 0 0\\nW ell, that’s not what we expected at all! Python interprets 1,000,000 as a co mma-\\nseparated sequence of integers, which it prints with spaces between.\\nThis is the ﬁrst example we have seen of a semantic error: the code runs without\\nproducing an error message, but it doesn’t do the “right” thing.\\n2.2 V ariables\\nOne of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to\\nmanipulatevariables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.\\nAn assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values:\\n>>> message = /quotesingle.ts1And now for something completely different/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> n = 17\\n>>> pi = 3.1415926535897931\\nThis example makes three assignments.

V ARIABLE NAMES AND KEYWORDS 21\\n2.3 V ariable names and keywords\\nProgrammers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful and\\ndocument what the variable is used for.\\nV ariable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and num bers,\\nbut they cannot start with a number. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is\\na good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you’ll see why later).\\nThe underscore character ( _ ) can appear in a name. It is often used in names with\\nmultiple words, such as my_name or airspeed_of_unladen_swallow. V ariable\\nnames can start with an underscore character, but we generally avoid doing this\\nunless we are writing library code for others to use.\\nIf you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:\\n>>> 76trombones = /quotesingle.ts1big parade/quotesingle.ts1\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n>>> more@ = 1000000\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n>>> class = /quotesingle.ts1Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy/quotesingle.ts1\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n76trombones is illegal because it begins with a number. more@ is illegal because\\nit contains an illegal character, @. But what’s wrong with class?\\nIt turns out that class is one of Python’s keywords. The interpreter uses keywords\\nto recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable\\nnames.\\nPython reserves 35 keywords:\\nFalse await else import pass\\nNone break except in raise\\nTrue class finally is return\\nand continue for lambda try\\nas def from nonlocal while\\nassert del global not with\\nasync elif if or yield\\nY ou might want to keep this list handy . If the interpreter complains about one of\\nyour variable names and you don’t know why , see if it is on this list.\\n2.4 Statements\\nA statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. W e have\\nseen two kinds of statements: print being an expression statement and assignmen t.\\nWhen you type a statement in interactive mode, the interpreter executes it and\\ndisplays the result, if there is one.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 33, 'page_label': '28'}, page_content='22 CHAPTER 2. V ARIABLES, EXPRESSIONS, AND ST A TEMENTS\\nA script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one\\nstatement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.\\nF or example, the script\\nprint(\\n1)\\nx = 2\\nprint(x)\\nproduces the output\\n1\\n2\\nThe assignment statement produces no output.\\n2.5 Operators and operands\\nOperators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and mul-\\ntiplication. The values the operator is applied to are called operands.\\nThe operators +, -, *, /, and ** perform addition, subtraction, multiplication,\\ndivision, and exponentiation, as in the following examples:\\n20+32\\nhour-1\\nhour*60+minute\\nminute/60\\n5**2\\n(5+9)*(15-7)\\nThere has been a change in the division operator between Python 2 and Python 3.\\nIn Python 3, the result of this division is a ﬂoating point result:\\n>>> minute = 59\\n>>> minute/60\\n0.9833333333333333\\nThe division operator in Python 2 would divide two integers and truncate the\\nresult to an integer:\\n>>> minute = 59\\n>>> minute/60\\n0\\nT o obtain the same answer in Python 3 use ﬂoored ( // integer) division.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 34, 'page_label': '29'}, page_content='2.6. EXPRESSIONS 23\\n>>> minute = 59\\n>>> minute//60\\n0\\nIn Python 3 integer division functions much more as you would expect if you\\nentered the expression on a calculator.\\n2.6 Expressions\\nAn expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by\\nitself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are a ll legal\\nexpressions (assuming that the variable x has been assigned a value):\\n17\\nx\\nx\\n+ 17\\nIf you type an expression in interactive mode, the interpreter evaluates it and\\ndisplays the result:\\n>>> 1 + 1\\n2\\nBut in a script, an expression all by itself doesn’t do anything! This is a commo n\\nsource of confusion for beginners.\\nExercise 1:Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what\\nthey do:\\n5\\nx = 5\\nx + 1\\n2.7 Order of operations\\nWhen more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation\\ndepends on the rules of precedence . F or mathematical operators, Python follows\\nmathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember\\nthe rules:\\n• P arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expres-\\nsion to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are\\nevaluated ﬁrst,2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. Y ou can also\\nuse parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100)\\n/ 60 , even if it doesn’t change the result.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 35, 'page_label': '30'}, page_content='24 CHAPTER 2. V ARIABLES, EXPRESSIONS, AND ST A TEMENTS\\n• E xponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 2**1+1 is 3, not 4, and\\n3*1**3 is 3, not 27.\\n• M ultiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than\\nAddition and S ubtraction, which also have the same precedence. So 2*3-1\\nis 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5.\\n• Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. So the\\nexpression 5-3-1 is 1, not 3, because the 5-3 happens ﬁrst and then 1 is\\nsubtracted from 2.\\nWhen in doubt, always put parentheses in your expressions to make sure the com-\\nputations are performed in the order you intend.\\n2.8 Modulus operator\\nThe modulus operator works on integers and yields the remainder when the ﬁrst\\noperand is divided by the second. In Python, the modulus operator is a percent\\nsign (%). The syntax is the same as for other operators:\\n>>> quotient = 7 // 3\\n>>> print(quotient)\\n2\\n>>> remainder = 7 % 3\\n>>> print(remainder)\\n1\\nSo 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.\\nThe modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. F or example, you can\\ncheck whether one number is divisible by another: if x % y is zero, then x is\\ndivisible by y.\\nY ou can also extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. F or exa mple,\\nx % 10 yields the right-most digit of x (in base 10). Similarly , x % 100 yields the\\nlast two digits.\\n2.9 String operations\\nThe + operator works with strings, but it is not addition in the mathematical sens e.\\nInstead it performs concatenation, which means joining the strings by linking them\\nend to end. F or example:\\n>>> first = 10\\n>>> second = 15\\n>>> print(first+second)\\n25\\n>>> first = /quotesingle.ts1100/quotesingle.ts1'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 36, 'page_label': '31'}, page_content='2.10. ASKING THE USER FOR INPUT 25\\n>>> second = /quotesingle.ts1150/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> print(first + second)\\n100150\\nThe * operator also works with strings by multiplying the content of a string by\\nan integer. F or example:\\n>>> first = /quotesingle.ts1Test /quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> second = 3\\n>>> print(first * second)\\nTest Test Test\\n2.10 Asking the user for input\\nSometimes we would like to take the value for a variable from the user via their\\nkeyboard. Python provides a built-in function called input that gets input from\\nthe keyboard\\n1 . When this function is called, the program stops and waits for the\\nuser to type something. When the user presses Return or Enter, the program\\nresumes and input returns what the user typed as a string.\\n>>> inp = input()\\nSome silly stuff\\n>>> print(inp)\\nSome silly stuff\\nBefore getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt telling the\\nuser what to input. Y ou can pass a string toinput to be displayed to the user\\nbefore pausing for input:\\n>>> name = input(/quotesingle.ts1What is your name?\\\\n/quotesingle.ts1)\\nWhat is your name?\\nChuck\\n>>> print(name)\\nChuck\\nThe sequence \\\\n at the end of the prompt represents a newline, which is a special\\ncharacter that causes a line break. That’s why the user’s input appears below the\\nprompt.\\nIf you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value\\ntoint using the int() function:\\n>>> prompt = /quotesingle.ts1What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\\\\n/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> speed = input(prompt)\\nWhat...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\\n17\\n1 In Python 2, this function was named raw_input.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 37, 'page_label': '32'}, page_content='26 CHAPTER 2. V ARIABLES, EXPRESSIONS, AND ST A TEMENTS\\n>>> int(speed)\\n17\\n>>> int(speed) + 5\\n22\\nBut if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error:\\n>>> speed = input(prompt)\\nWhat...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\\nWhat do you mean, an African or a European swallow?\\n>>> int(speed)\\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with\\nbase 10: /quotesingle.ts1What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?/quotesingle.ts1\\nW e will see how to handle this kind of error later.\\n2.11 Comments\\nAs programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more diﬃcult to read.\\nF ormal languages are dense, and it is often diﬃcult to look at a piece of code and\\nﬁgure out what it is doing, or why .\\nF or this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in\\nnatural language what the program is doing. These notes are calledcomments,\\nand in Python they start with the # symbol:\\n# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed\\npercentage = (minute * 100) / 60\\nIn this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. Y ou can also put comments\\nat the end of a line:\\npercentage\\n= (minute * 100) / 60 # percentage of an hour\\nEverything from the # to the end of the line is ignored; it has no eﬀect on the\\nprogram.\\nComments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code.\\nIt is reasonable to assume that the reader can ﬁgure outwhat the code does; it is\\nmuch more useful to explain why.\\nThis comment is redundant with the code and useless:\\nv\\n= 5 # assign 5 to v\\nThis comment contains useful information that is not in the code:\\nv = 5 # velocity in meters/second.\\nGood variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make\\ncomplex expressions hard to read, so there is a trade-oﬀ.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 38, 'page_label': '33'}, page_content='2.12. CHOOSING MNEMONIC V ARIABLE NAMES 27\\n2.12 Choosing mnemonic variable names\\nAs long as you follow the simple rules of variable naming, and avoid reserv ed\\nwords, you have a lot of choice when you name your variables. In the beginning,\\nthis choice can be confusing both when you read a program and when you write\\nyour own programs. F or example, the following three programs are identical in\\nterms of what they accomplish, but very diﬀerent when you read them and try to\\nunderstand them.\\na\\n= 35.0\\nb = 12.50\\nc = a * b\\nprint(c)\\nhours\\n= 35.0\\nrate = 12.50\\npay = hours * rate\\nprint(pay)\\nx1q3z9ahd\\n= 35.0\\nx1q3z9afd = 12.50\\nx1q3p9afd = x1q3z9ahd * x1q3z9afd\\nprint(x1q3p9afd)\\nThe Python interpreter sees all three of these programs as exactly the same but\\nhumans see and understand these programs quite diﬀerently . Humans will most\\nquickly understand theintent of the second program because the programmer has\\nchosen variable names that reﬂect their intent regarding what data will be stored\\nin each variable.\\nW e call these wisely chosen variable names “mnemonic variable names” . The word\\nmnemonic\\n2 means “memory aid” . W e choose mnemonic variable names to help us\\nremember why we created the variable in the ﬁrst place.\\nWhile this all sounds great, and it is a very good idea to use mnemonic variable\\nnames, mnemonic variable names can get in the way of a beginning programmer’s\\nability to parse and understand code. This is because beginning programmers have\\nnot yet memorized the reserved words (there are only 35 of them) and sometimes\\nvariables with names that are too descriptive start to look like part of t he language\\nand not just well-chosen variable names.\\nT ake a quick look at the following Python sample code which loops through s ome\\ndata. W e will cover loops soon, but for now try to just puzzle through what this\\nmeans:\\nfor word in words:\\nprint(word)\\n2 See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic for an extended description of the word\\n“mnemonic” .'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 39, 'page_label': '34'}, page_content='28 CHAPTER 2. V ARIABLES, EXPRESSIONS, AND ST A TEMENTS\\nWhat is happening here? Which of the tokens (for, word, in, etc.) are reserved\\nwords and which are just variable names? Does Python understand at a funda-\\nmental level the notion of words? Beginning programmers have trouble separating\\nwhat parts of the code must be the same as this example and what parts of the\\ncode are simply choices made by the programmer.\\nThe following code is equivalent to the above code:\\nfor slice in pizza:\\nprint(slice)\\nIt is easier for the beginning programmer to look at this code and know which part s\\nare reserved words deﬁned by Python and which parts are simply variable names\\nchosen by the programmer. It is pretty clear that Python has no fundamental\\nunderstanding of pizza and slices and the fact that a pizza consists of a set of one\\nor more slices.\\nBut if our program is truly about reading data and looking for words in the data,\\npizza and slice are very un-mnemonic variable names. Choosing them as variable\\nnames distracts from the meaning of the program.\\nAfter a pretty short period of time, you will know the most common reserved w ords\\nand you will start to see the reserved words jumping out at you:\\nThe parts of the code that are deﬁned by Python ( for, in, print, and :) are in\\nbold and the programmer-chosen variables ( word and words) are not in bold. Many\\ntext editors are aware of Python syntax and will color reserved words diﬀer ently\\nto give you clues to keep your variables and reserved words separate. After a while\\nyou will begin to read Python and quickly determine what is a variable and wha t\\nis a reserved word.\\n2.13 Debugging\\nAt this point, the syntax error you are most likely to make is an ill egal variable\\nname, like class and yield, which are keywords, or odd~job and US$, which\\ncontain illegal characters.\\nIf you put a space in a variable name, Python thinks it is two operands without\\nan operator:\\n>>> bad name = 5\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\nF or syntax errors, the error messages don’t help much. The most common messag es\\nare SyntaxError: invalid syntax which is not very informative.\\nThe runtime error you are most likely to make is a “use before def;” that i s, trying\\nto use a variable before you have assigned a value.

CONDITIONAL EXECUTION\\n3.2 Logical operators\\nThere are three logical operators : and, or, and not. The semantics (meaning) of\\nthese operators is similar to their meaning in English. F or example,\\nx > 0 and x < 10\\nis true only ifx is greater than 0 and less than 10.\\nn%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0 is true if either of the conditions is true, that is, if the\\nnumber is divisible by 2 or 3.\\nFinally , the not operator negates a boolean expression, so not (x > y) is true if\\nx > y is false.\\n>>> x = 1\\n>>> y = 2\\n>>> x > y\\nFalse\\n>>> not (x > y)\\nTrue\\nStrictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean ex pres-\\nsions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as “true. ”\\n>>> 17 and True\\nTrue\\nThis ﬂexibility can be useful in some situations, but there are some subtleties to it\\nthat might be confusing. Y ou might want to avoid it until you are sure y ou know\\nwhat you are doing.\\n3.3 Conditional execution\\nIn order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to checkcondi-\\ntions and change the behavior of the program accordingly . Conditional statements\\ngive us this ability . The simplest form is the if statement:\\nif x > 0 :\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1x is positive/quotesingle.ts1)\\nThe boolean expression after the if statement is called the condition. W e end the\\nif statement with a colon character (:) and the line(s) after the if statement ar e\\nindented.\\nIf the logical condition is true, then the indented statement gets executed. If the\\nlogical condition is false, the indented statement is skipped.\\nifstatements have the same structure as function deﬁnitions or for loops\\n1 . The\\nstatement consists of a header line that ends with the colon character (:) followed\\n1W e will learn about functions in Chapter 4 and loops in Chapte r 5.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 44, 'page_label': '39'}, page_content='3.3.

Statements like this are called compound statements because\\nthey stretch across more than one line.\\nif x > y:\\nprint(x)\\nprint(y)\\nThere is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body , but\\nthere must be at least one. Occasionally , it is useful to have a body with no\\nstatements (usually as a place holder for code you haven’t written yet). In that\\ncase, you can use thepass statement to pass the Python interpreter check, which\\ndoes nothing.\\nif x < 0 :\\npass # need to handle negative values, do nothing for now.\\nIf you enter an if statement in the Python interpreter, the prompt will change\\nfrom three chevrons (»>) to three dots (. . . ) to indicate you are in the middle of\\na block of statements, as shown below:\\n>>> x = 3\\n>>> if x < 10:\\n... print( /quotesingle.ts1Small/quotesingle.ts1)\\n...\\nSmall\\n>>>\\nWhen using the Python interpreter, you must leave a blank line at the end of a\\nblock, otherwise Python will return an error:\\n>>> x = 3\\n>>> if x < 10:\\n... print( /quotesingle.ts1Small/quotesingle.ts1)\\n... print( /quotesingle.ts1Done/quotesingle.ts1)\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 3\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Done/quotesingle.ts1)\\nˆ\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 45, 'page_label': '40'}, page_content='34 CHAPTER 3.

The syntax\\nlooks like this:\\nif x % 2 == 0:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1x is even/quotesingle.ts1)\\nelse:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1x is odd/quotesingle.ts1)\\nIf the remainder when x is divided by 2 is 0, then we know that x is even, and the\\nprogram displays a message to that eﬀect. If the condition is false, the second set\\nof statements is executed.\\nSince the condition must either be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will\\nbe executed. The alternatives are called branches, because they are branches in\\nthe ﬂow of execution.\\n3.5 Chained conditionals\\nSometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two\\nbranches. One way to express a computation like that is achained conditional :\\nif x < y:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1x is less than y/quotesingle.ts1)\\nelif x > y:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1x is greater than y/quotesingle.ts1)\\nelse:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1x and y are equal/quotesingle.ts1)'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 46, 'page_label': '41'}, page_content='3.6.

Even if more than one condition is true, only the ﬁrst true branch executes.\\n3.6 Nested conditionals\\nOne conditional can also be nested within another. W e could have written the\\nthree-branch example like this:\\nif x == y:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1x and y are equal/quotesingle.ts1)\\nelse:\\nif x < y:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1x is less than y/quotesingle.ts1)\\nelse:\\nprint(\\n/quotesingle.ts1x is greater than y/quotesingle.ts1)\\nThe outer conditional contains two branches. The ﬁrst branch contains a simple\\nstatement. The second branch contains another if statement, which has two\\nbranches of its own.

In general, it is a good idea to\\navoid them when you can.\\nLogical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements.\\nF or example, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional:\\nif 0 < x:\\nif x < 10:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1x is a positive single-digit number./quotesingle.ts1)\\nThe print statement is executed only when we pass both conditionals.

It does not execute the following\\nstatement.\\nHere is a sample program to convert a F ahrenheit temperature to a Celsius tem-\\nperature:\\ninp\\n= input(/quotesingle.ts1Enter Fahrenheit Temperature: /quotesingle.ts1)\\nfahr = float(inp)\\ncel = (fahr - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0\\nprint(cel)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/fahren.py\\nIf we execute this code and give it invalid input, it simply fails with an unfri endly\\nerror message:\\npython fahren.py\\nEnter Fahrenheit Temperature:72\\n22.22222222222222\\npython fahren.py\\nEnter Fahrenheit Temperature:fred\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"fahren.py\", line 2, in <module>\\nfahr = float(inp)\\nValueError: could not convert string to float: /quotesingle.ts1fred/quotesingle.ts1\\nThere is a conditional execution structure built into Python to handle these types\\nof expected and unexpected errors called “try / except” . The purpose of try and\\nexcept is that you know that some sequence of instruction(s) may have a problem\\nand you want to add some statements to be executed if an error occurs. These\\nextra statements (the except block) are ignored if there is no error.\\nY ou can think of the try and except feature in Python as an “insurance policy”\\non a sequence of statements.\\nW e can rewrite our temperature converter as follows:\\ninp\\n= input(/quotesingle.ts1Enter Fahrenheit Temperature:/quotesingle.ts1)\\ntry:\\nfahr = float(inp)\\ncel = (fahr - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0\\nprint(cel)\\nexcept:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Please enter a number/quotesingle.ts1)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/fahren2.py'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 49, 'page_label': '44'}, page_content='38 CHAPTER 3. CONDITIONAL EXECUTION\\nPython starts by executing the sequence of statements in the try block. If all goes\\nwell, it skips the except block and proceeds. If an exception occurs in the try\\nblock, Python jumps out of the try block and executes the sequence of statements\\nin the except block.\\npython fahren2.py\\nEnter Fahrenheit Temperature:72\\n22.22222222222222\\npython fahren2.py\\nEnter Fahrenheit Temperature:fred\\nPlease enter a number\\nHandling an exception with atry statement is called catching an exception. In\\nthis example, the except clause prints an error message. In general, catching an\\nexception gives you a chance to ﬁx the problem, or try again, or at least end the\\nprogram gracefully .\\n3.8 Short-circuit evaluation of logical expressions\\nWhen Python is processing a logical expression such as x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2 , it\\nevaluates the expression from left to right. Because of the deﬁnition of and, if x is\\nless than 2, the expression x >= 2 is False and so the whole expression is False\\nregardless of whether (x/y) > 2 evaluates to True or False.\\nWhen Python detects that there is nothing to be gained by evaluating the rest\\nof a logical expression, it stops its evaluation and does not do the computations\\nin the rest of the logical expression. When the evaluation of a logical expression\\nstops because the overall value is already known, it is called short-circuiting the\\nevaluation.\\nWhile this may seem like a ﬁne point, the short-circuit behavior leads to a clever\\ntechnique called the guardian pattern . Consider the following code sequence in the\\nPython interpreter:\\n>>> x = 6\\n>>> y = 2\\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2\\nTrue\\n>>> x = 1\\n>>> y = 0\\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2\\nFalse\\n>>> x = 6\\n>>> y = 0\\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\\n>>>'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 50, 'page_label': '45'}, page_content='3.9. DEBUGGING 39\\nThe third calculation failed because Python was evaluating (x/y) and y was zero,\\nwhich causes a runtime error. But the ﬁrst and the second examples did not fail\\nbecause in the ﬁrst calculation y was non zero and in the second one the ﬁrst part\\nof these expressions x >= 2 evaluated to False so the (x/y) was not ever executed\\ndue to the short-circuit rule and there was no error.\\nW e can construct the logical expression to strategically place a guard evaluation\\njust before the evaluation that might cause an error as follows:\\n>>> x = 1\\n>>> y = 0\\n>>> x >= 2 and y != 0 and (x/y) > 2\\nFalse\\n>>> x = 6\\n>>> y = 0\\n>>> x >= 2 and y != 0 and (x/y) > 2\\nFalse\\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2 and y != 0\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\\n>>>\\nIn the ﬁrst logical expression, x >= 2 is False so the evaluation stops at the and.\\nIn the second logical expression, x >= 2 is True but y != 0 is False so we never\\nreach (x/y).\\nIn the third logical expression, the y != 0 is after the (x/y) calculation so the\\nexpression fails with an error.\\nIn the second expression, we say thaty != 0 acts as a guard to insure that we\\nonly execute (x/y) if y is non-zero.\\n3.9 Debugging\\nThe traceback Python displays when an error occurs contains a lot of informatio n,\\nbut it can be overwhelming. The most useful parts are usually:\\n• What kind of error it was, and\\n• Where it occurred.\\nSyntax errors are usually easy to ﬁnd, but there are a few gotchas.

When you deﬁne a function, you specify the name and\\nthe sequence of statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name. W e have\\nalready seen one example of afunction cal l :\\n>>> type(32)\\n<class /quotesingle.ts1int/quotesingle.ts1>\\nThe name of the function is type. The expression in parentheses is called the\\nargument of the function. The argument is a value or variable that we are passing\\ninto the function as input to the function. The result, for the type function, is the\\ntype of the argument.\\nIt is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result.\\nThe result is called the return value .\\n4.2 Built-in functions\\nPython provides a number of important built-in functions that we can use without\\nneeding to provide the function deﬁnition. The creators of Python wrote a set of\\nfunctions to solve common problems and included them in Python for us to use.\\nThe max and min functions give us the largest and smallest values in a list, respec-\\ntively:\\n>>> max(/quotesingle.ts1Hello world/quotesingle.ts1)\\n/quotesingle.ts1w/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> min(/quotesingle.ts1Hello world/quotesingle.ts1)\\n/quotesingle.ts1 /quotesingle.ts1\\n>>>\\n43'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 55, 'page_label': '50'}, page_content='44 CHAPTER 4. FUNCTIONS\\nThe max function tells us the “largest character” in the string (which turns out to\\nbe the letter “w”) and the min function shows us the smallest character (which\\nturns out to be a space).\\nAnother very common built-in function is the len function which tells us how many\\nitems are in its argument. If the argument to len is a string, it returns the number\\nof characters in the string.\\n>>> len(/quotesingle.ts1Hello world/quotesingle.ts1)\\n11\\n>>>\\nThese functions are not limited to looking at strings. They can operate on any set\\nof values, as we will see in later chapters.\\nY ou should treat the names of built-in functions as reserved words (i.e., avoid usi ng\\n“max” as a variable name).\\n4.3 Type conversion functions\\nPython also provides built-in functions that convert values from one type to an-\\nother. Theint function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or\\ncomplains otherwise:\\n>>> int(/quotesingle.ts132/quotesingle.ts1)\\n32\\n>>> int(/quotesingle.ts1Hello/quotesingle.ts1)\\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: /quotesingle.ts1Hello/quotesingle.ts1\\nint can convert ﬂoating-point values to integers, but it doesn’t round oﬀ; it chops\\noﬀ the fraction part:\\n>>> int(3.99999)\\n3\\n>>> int(-2.3)\\n-2\\nfloat converts integers and strings to ﬂoating-point numbers:\\n>>> float(32)\\n32.0\\n>>> float(/quotesingle.ts13.14159/quotesingle.ts1)\\n3.14159\\nFinally , str converts its argument to a string:\\n>>> str(32)\\n/quotesingle.ts132/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> str(3.14159)\\n/quotesingle.ts13.14159/quotesingle.ts1'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 56, 'page_label': '51'}, page_content='4.4. MA TH FUNCTIONS 45\\n4.4 Math functions\\nPython has amath module that provides most of the familiar mathematical func-\\ntions. Before we can use the module, we have to import it:\\n>>> import math\\nThis statement creates a module object named math. If you print the module\\nobject, you get some information about it:\\n>>> print(math)\\n<module /quotesingle.ts1math/quotesingle.ts1(built-in)>\\nThe module object contains the functions and variables deﬁned in the module. T o\\naccess one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the\\nname of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is\\ncalled dot notation .\\n>>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power\\n>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)\\n>>> radians = 0.7\\n>>> height = math.sin(radians)\\nThe ﬁrst example computes the logarithm base 10 of the signal-to-noise ratio. T he\\nmath module also provides a function called log that computes logarithms base e.\\nThe second example ﬁnds the sine of radians. The name of the variable is a hint\\nthat sin and the other trigonometric functions ( cos, tan, etc.) take arguments in\\nradians. T o convert from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2 π :\\n>>> degrees = 45\\n>>> radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi\\n>>> math.sin(radians)\\n0.7071067811865476\\nThe expression math.pi gets the variable pi from the math module. The value of\\nthis variable is an approximation of π , accurate to about 15 digits.\\nIf you know your trigonometry , you can check the previous result by comparing it\\nto the square root of two divided by two:\\n>>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0\\n0.7071067811865476'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 57, 'page_label': '52'}, page_content='46 CHAPTER 4. FUNCTIONS\\n4.5 Random numbers\\nGiven the same inputs, most computer programs generate the same outputs every\\ntime, so they are said to bedeterministic. Determinism is usually a good thing,\\nsince we expect the same calculation to yield the same result. F or some applica-\\ntions, though, we want the computer to be unpredictable. Games are an obvious\\nexample, but there are more.\\nMaking a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be not so easy , but there\\nare ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic. One of them is to useal-\\ngorithms that generate pseudorandom numbers. Pseudorandom numbers are not\\ntruly random because they are generated by a deterministic computation, but just\\nby looking at the numbers it is all but impossible to distinguish them from random.\\nThe random module provides functions that generate pseudorandom numbers\\n(which I will simply call “random” from here on).\\nThe function random returns a random ﬂoat between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0\\nbut not 1.0). Each time you call random, you get the next number in a long series.\\nT o see a sample, run this loop:\\nimport random\\nfor i in range(10):\\nx = random.random()\\nprint(x)\\nThis program produces the following list of 10 random numbers between 0.0 and\\nup to but not including 1.0.\\n0.11132867921152356\\n0.5950949227890241\\n0.04820265884996877\\n0.841003109276478\\n0.997914947094958\\n0.04842330803368111\\n0.7416295948208405\\n0.510535245390327\\n0.27447040171978143\\n0.028511805472785867\\nExercise 1:Run the program on your system and see what numbers you get. Run\\nthe program more than once and see what numbers you get.\\nThe random function is only one of many functions that handle random numbers.\\nThe function randint takes the parameters low and high, and returns an integer\\nbetween low and high (including both).\\n>>> random.randint(5, 10)\\n5\\n>>> random.randint(5, 10)\\n9'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 58, 'page_label': '53'}, page_content='4.6. ADDING NEW FUNCTIONS 47\\nT o choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use choice:\\n>>> t = [1, 2, 3]\\n>>> random.choice(t)\\n2\\n>>> random.choice(t)\\n3\\nThe random module also provides functions to generate random values from con-\\ntinuous distributions including Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more.\\n4.6 Adding new functions\\nSo far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also\\npossible to add new functions. Afunction deﬁnition speciﬁes the name of a new\\nfunction and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.\\nOnce we deﬁne a function, we can reuse the function over and over throughout our\\nprogram.\\nHere is an example:\\ndef print_lyrics():\\nprint(\\n\"I/quotesingle.ts1m a lumberjack, and I/quotesingle.ts1m okay.\")\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1I sleep all night and I work all day./quotesingle.ts1)\\ndef is a keyword that indicates that this is a function deﬁnition. The name of\\nthe function is print_lyrics. The rules for function names are the same as for\\nvariable names: letters, numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the\\nﬁrst character can’t be a number. Y ou can’t use a keyword as the name of a\\nfunction, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same\\nname.\\nThe empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any\\narguments. Later we will build functions that take arguments as their inputs.\\nThe ﬁrst line of the function deﬁnition is called the header; the rest is called\\nthe body. The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented.\\nBy convention, the indentation is always four spaces. The body can contain any\\nnumber of statements.\\nIf you type a function deﬁnition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints ellipses\\n(. . . ) to let you know that the deﬁnition isn’t complete:\\n>>> def print_lyrics():\\n... print( \"I/quotesingle.ts1m a lumberjack, and I/quotesingle.ts1m okay.\")\\n... print( /quotesingle.ts1I sleep all night and I work all day./quotesingle.ts1)\\n...\\nT o end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is not necessary in a\\nscript).\\nDeﬁning a function creates a variable with the same name.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 59, 'page_label': '54'}, page_content='48 CHAPTER 4. FUNCTIONS\\n>>> print(print_lyrics)\\n<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c>\\n>>> print(type(print_lyrics))\\n<class /quotesingle.ts1function/quotesingle.ts1>\\nThe value of print_lyrics is a function object , which has type “function” .\\nThe syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in functions:\\n>>> print_lyrics()\\nI/quotesingle.ts1m a lumberjack, and I/quotesingle.ts1m okay.\\nI sleep all night and I work all day.\\nOnce you have deﬁned a function, you can use it inside another function. F or exam-\\nple, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write a function calledrepeat_lyrics:\\ndef repeat_lyrics():\\nprint_lyrics()\\nprint_lyrics()\\nAnd then call repeat_lyrics:\\n>>> repeat_lyrics()\\nI/quotesingle.ts1m a lumberjack, and I/quotesingle.ts1m okay.\\nI sleep all night and I work all day.\\nI/quotesingle.ts1m a lumberjack, and I/quotesingle.ts1m okay.\\nI sleep all night and I work all day.\\nBut that’s not really how the song goes.\\n4.7 Deﬁnitions and uses\\nPulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program\\nlooks like this:\\ndef print_lyrics():\\nprint(\\n\"I/quotesingle.ts1m a lumberjack, and I/quotesingle.ts1m okay.\")\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1I sleep all night and I work all day./quotesingle.ts1)\\ndef repeat_lyrics():\\nprint_lyrics()\\nprint_lyrics()\\nrepeat_lyrics()\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/lyrics.py'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 60, 'page_label': '55'}, page_content='4.8. FLOW OF EXECUTION 49\\nThis program has two function deﬁnitions: print_lyrics and repeat_lyrics.\\nF unction deﬁnitions get executed just like other statements, but the eﬀect is to\\ncreate function objects. The statements inside the function do not get executed\\nuntil the function is called, and the function deﬁnition generates no output.\\nAs you might expect, you have to create a function before you can execute it. In\\nother words, the function deﬁnition has to be executed before the ﬁrst time it is\\ncalled.\\nExercise 2:Move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call\\nappears before the deﬁnitions. Run the program and see what error message you\\nget.\\nExercise 3:Move the function call back to the bottom and move the deﬁnition\\nof print_lyrics after the deﬁnition of repeat_lyrics. What happens when you\\nrun this program?\\n4.8 Flow of execution\\nIn order to ensure that a function is deﬁned before its ﬁrst use, you have to know\\nthe order in which statements are executed, which is called theﬂow of execution .\\nExecution always begins at the ﬁrst statement of the program. Statements are\\nexecuted one at a time, in order from top to bottom.\\nF unctiondeﬁnitions do not alter the ﬂow of execution of the program, but re-\\nmember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is\\ncalled.\\nA function call is like a detour in the ﬂow of execution. Instead of going to the next\\nstatement, the ﬂow jumps to the body of the function, executes all the statements\\nthere, and then comes back to pick up where it left oﬀ.\\nThat sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another.\\nWhile in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the state-\\nments in another function. But while executing that new function, the program\\nmight have to execute yet another function!\\nF ortunately , Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function\\ncompletes, the program picks up where it left oﬀ in the function that called it.\\nWhen it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.\\nWhat’s the moral of this sordid tale? When you read a program, you don’t always\\nwant to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you fo llow the\\nﬂow of execution.\\n4.9 Parameters and arguments\\nSome of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments. F or example, when\\nyou call math.sin you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more\\nthan one argument: math.pow takes two, the base and the exponent.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 61, 'page_label': '56'}, page_content='50 CHAPTER 4. FUNCTIONS\\nInside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters.\\nHere is an example of a user-deﬁned function that takes an argument:\\ndef print_twice(bruce):\\nprint(bruce)\\nprint(bruce)\\nThis function assigns the argument to a parameter named bruce. When the func-\\ntion is called, it prints the value of the parameter (whatever it is) twice.\\nThis function works with any value that can be printed.\\n>>> print_twice(/quotesingle.ts1Spam/quotesingle.ts1)\\nSpam\\nSpam\\n>>> print_twice(17)\\n17\\n17\\n>>> import math\\n>>> print_twice(math.pi)\\n3.141592653589793\\n3.141592653589793\\nThe same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also apply to\\nuser-deﬁned functions, so we can use any kind of expression as an argument for\\nprint_twice:\\n>>> print_twice(/quotesingle.ts1Spam /quotesingle.ts1*4)\\nSpam Spam Spam Spam\\nSpam Spam Spam Spam\\n>>> print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))\\n-1.0\\n-1.0\\nThe argument is evaluated before the function is called, so in the examples the\\nexpressions /quotesingle.ts1Spam /quotesingle.ts1*4and math.cos(math.pi) are only evaluated once.\\nY ou can also use a variable as an argument:\\n>>> michael = /quotesingle.ts1Eric, the half a bee./quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> print_twice(michael)\\nEric, the half a bee.\\nEric, the half a bee.\\nThe name of the variable we pass as an argument ( michael) has nothing to do\\nwith the name of the parameter ( bruce). It doesn’t matter what the value was\\ncalled back home (in the caller); here in print_twice, we call everybody bruce.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 62, 'page_label': '57'}, page_content='4.10. FRUITFUL FUNCTIONS AND VOID FUNCTIONS 51\\n4.10 F ruitful functions and void functions\\nSome of the functions we are using, such as the math functions, yield results;\\nfor lack of a better name, I call themfruitful functions . Other functions, like\\nprint_twice, perform an action but don’t return a value. They are called void\\nfunctions.\\nWhen you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something wit h\\nthe result; for example, you might assign it to a variable or use it as par t of an\\nexpression:\\nx\\n= math.cos(radians)\\ngolden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2\\nWhen you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result:\\n>>> math.sqrt(5)\\n2.23606797749979\\nBut in a script, if you call a fruitful function and do not store the result of the\\nfunction in a variable, the return value vanishes into the mist!\\nmath.sqrt(\\n5)\\nThis script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn’t store the result in\\na variable or display the result, it is not very useful.\\nV oid functions might display something on the screen or have some other eﬀect,\\nbut they don’t have a return value. If you try to assign the result to a variable,\\nyou get a special value called None.\\n>>> result = print_twice(/quotesingle.ts1Bing/quotesingle.ts1)\\nBing\\nBing\\n>>> print(result)\\nNone\\nThe value None is not the same as the string “None” . It is a special value that has\\nits own type:\\n>>> print(type(None))\\n<class /quotesingle.ts1NoneType/quotesingle.ts1>\\nT o return a result from a function, we use the return statement in our function.\\nF or example, we could make a very simple function called addtwo that adds two\\nnumbers together and returns a result.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 63, 'page_label': '58'}, page_content='52 CHAPTER 4. FUNCTIONS\\ndef addtwo(a, b):\\nadded\\n= a + b\\nreturn added\\nx = addtwo(3, 5)\\nprint(x)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/addtwo.py\\nWhen this script executes, the print statement will print out “8” because the\\naddtwo function was called with 3 and 5 as arguments. Within the function, the\\nparameters a and b were 3 and 5 respectively . The function computed the sum of\\nthe two numbers and placed it in the local function variable named added. Then\\nit used the return statement to send the computed value back to the calling code\\nas the function result, which was assigned to the variable x and printed out.\\n4.11 Why functions?\\nIt may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions.\\nThere are several reasons:\\n• Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of state-\\nments, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and debug.\\n• F unctions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later,\\nif you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\\n• Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at\\na time and then assemble them into a working whole.\\n• W ell-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write\\nand debug one, you can reuse it.\\nThroughout the rest of the book, often we will use a function deﬁnition to explain\\na concept. Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function\\nproperly capture an idea such as “ﬁnd the smallest value in a list of values” . Later\\nwe will show you code that ﬁnds the smallest in a list of values and we will presen t\\nit to you as a function named min which takes a list of values as its argument and\\nreturns the smallest value in the list.\\n4.12 Debugging\\nIf you are using a text editor to write your scripts, you might run into problems with\\nspaces and tabs. The best way to avoid these problems is to use spaces exclusively\\n(no tabs). Most text editors that know about Python do this by default, but some\\ndon’t.\\nT abs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them hard to debug, so try to\\nﬁnd an editor that manages indentation for you.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 64, 'page_label': '59'}, page_content='4.13. GLOSSAR Y 53\\nAlso, don’t forget to save your program before you run it. Some development\\nenvironments do this automatically , but some don’t. In that case, the program\\nyou are looking at in the text editor is not the same as the program you are\\nrunning.\\nDebugging can take a long time if you keep running the same incorrect program\\nover and over!\\nMake sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running.

W e call the vari -\\nable that changes each time the loop executes and controls when the loop ﬁnishes\\ntheiteration variable . If there is no iteration variable, the loop will repeat forever,\\nresulting in an inﬁnite loop .\\n5.3 Inﬁnite loops\\nAn endless source of amusement for programmers is the observation that the di-\\nrections on shampoo, “Lather, rinse, repeat,” are an inﬁnite loop because there i s\\nno iteration variable telling you how many times to execute the loop.\\nIn the case of countdown, we can prove that the loop terminates because we know\\nthat the value of n is ﬁnite, and we can see that the value of n gets smaller each\\ntime through the loop, so eventually we have to get to 0. Other times a loop is\\nobviously inﬁnite because it has no iteration variable at all.\\nSometimes you don’t know it’s time to end a loop until you get half way through\\nthe body . In that case you can write an inﬁnite loop on purpose and then use the\\nbreakstatement to jump out of the loop.\\nThis loop is obviously an inﬁnite loop because the logical expression on the while\\nstatement is simply the logical constant True:\\nn\\n= 10\\nwhile True:\\nprint(n, end =/quotesingle.ts1 /quotesingle.ts1)\\nn = n - 1\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Done!/quotesingle.ts1)'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 70, 'page_label': '65'}, page_content='5.4. FINISHING ITERA TIONS WITH CONTINUE 59\\nIf you make the mistake and run this code, you will learn quickly how to sto p\\na runaway Python process on your system or ﬁnd where the power-oﬀ button is\\non your computer. This program will run forever or until your battery runs out\\nbecause the logical expression at the top of the loop is always true by virtue of the\\nfact that the expression is the constant value True.\\nWhile this is a dysfunctional inﬁnite loop, we can still use this pattern to build\\nuseful loops as long as we carefully add code to the body of the loop to explicitly\\nexit the loop usingbreak when we have reached the exit condition.\\nF or example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they type done.\\nY ou could write:\\nwhile True:\\nline = input(/quotesingle.ts1> /quotesingle.ts1)\\nif line == /quotesingle.ts1done/quotesingle.ts1:\\nbreak\\nprint(line)\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Done!/quotesingle.ts1)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/copytildone1.py\\nThe loop condition is True, which is always true, so the loop runs repeatedly until\\nit hits the break statement.\\nEach time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket. If the user types\\ndone, the break statement exits the loop. Otherwise the program echoes whatever\\nthe user types and goes back to the top of the loop. Here’s a sample run:\\n> hello there\\nhello there\\n> finished\\nfinished\\n> done\\nDone!\\nThis way of writing while loops is common because you can check the condition\\nanywhere in the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition\\naﬃrmatively (“stop when this happens”) rather than negatively (“keep going until\\nthat happens. ”).\\n5.4 Finishing iterations withcontinue\\nSometimes you are in an iteration of a loop and want to ﬁnish the current iter ation\\nand immediately jump to the next iteration. In that case you can use the continue\\nstatement to skip to the next iteration without ﬁnishing the body of the loop fo r\\nthe current iteration.\\nHere is an example of a loop that copies its input until the user types “done”, but\\ntreats lines that start with the hash character as lines not to be printed (kindof\\nlike Python comments).'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 71, 'page_label': '66'}, page_content='60 CHAPTER 5. ITERA TION\\nwhile True:\\nline = input(/quotesingle.ts1> /quotesingle.ts1)\\nif line[0] == /quotesingle.ts1#/quotesingle.ts1:\\ncontinue\\nif line == /quotesingle.ts1done/quotesingle.ts1:\\nbreak\\nprint(line)\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Done!/quotesingle.ts1)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/copytildone2.py\\nHere is a sample run of this new program with continue added.\\n> hello there\\nhello there\\n> # don/quotesingle.ts1t print this\\n> print this!\\nprint this!\\n> done\\nDone!\\nAll the lines are printed except the one that starts with the hash sign because\\nwhen the continue is executed, it ends the current iteration and jumps back to\\nthe while statement to start the next iteration, thus skipping the print statement.\\n5.5 Deﬁnite loops using for\\nSometimes we want to loop through a set of things such as a list of words, the lines\\nin a ﬁle, or a list of numbers. When we have a list of things to loop through, we\\ncan construct adeﬁnite loop using a for statement. W e call the while statement\\nan indeﬁnite loop because it simply loops until some condition becomes False,\\nwhereas the for loop is looping through a known set of items so it runs through\\nas many iterations as there are items in the set.\\nThe syntax of a for loop is similar to the while loop in that there is a for\\nstatement and a loop body:\\nfriends\\n= [/quotesingle.ts1Joseph/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1Glenn/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1Sally/quotesingle.ts1]\\nfor friend in friends:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Happy New Year:/quotesingle.ts1, friend)\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Done!/quotesingle.ts1)\\nIn Python terms, the variable friends is a list 1 of three strings and the for loop\\ngoes through the list and executes the body once for each of the three strings in\\nthe list resulting in this output:\\n1W e will examine lists in more detail in a later chapter.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 72, 'page_label': '67'}, page_content='5.6. LOOP P A TTERNS 61\\nHappy New Year: Joseph\\nHappy New Year: Glenn\\nHappy New Year: Sally\\nDone\\n!\\nT ranslating this for loop to English is not as direct as the while, but if you think\\nof friends as a set, it goes like this: “Run the statements in the body of the for\\nloop once for each friend in the set named friends. ”\\nLooking at the for loop, for and in are reserved Python keywords, and friend\\nand friends are variables.\\nfor friend in friends:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Happy New Year:/quotesingle.ts1, friend)\\nIn particular, friend is the iteration variable for the for loop. The variable friend\\nchanges for each iteration of the loop and controls when the for loop completes.\\nThe iteration variable steps successively through the three strings stored in the\\nfriends variable.\\n5.6 Loop patterns\\nOften we use afor or while loop to go through a list of items or the contents of\\na ﬁle and we are looking for something such as the largest or smallest value of the\\ndata we scan through.\\nThese loops are generally constructed by:\\n• Initializing one or more variables before the loop starts\\n• Performing some computation on each item in the loop body , possibly chang-\\ning the variables in the body of the loop\\n• Looking at the resulting variables when the loop completes\\nW e will use a list of numbers to demonstrate the concepts and construction of these\\nloop patterns.\\n5.6.1 Counting and summing loops\\nF or example, to count the number of items in a list, we would write the following\\nfor loop:\\ncount\\n= 0\\nfor itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:\\ncount = count + 1\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Count: /quotesingle.ts1, count)'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 73, 'page_label': '68'}, page_content='62 CHAPTER 5. ITERA TION\\nW e set the variable count to zero before the loop starts, then we write a for loop\\nto run through the list of numbers. Our iteration variable is named itervar and\\nwhile we do not use itervar in the loop, it does control the loop and cause the\\nloop body to be executed once for each of the values in the list.\\nIn the body of the loop, we add 1 to the current value ofcount for each of the\\nvalues in the list. While the loop is executing, the value of count is the number\\nof values we have seen “so far” .\\nOnce the loop completes, the value ofcount is the total number of items. The\\ntotal number “falls in our lap” at the end of the loop. W e construct the loop so\\nthat we have what we want when the loop ﬁnishes.\\nAnother similar loop that computes the total of a set of numbers is as follow s:\\ntotal\\n= 0\\nfor itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:\\ntotal = total + itervar\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Total: /quotesingle.ts1, total)\\nIn this loop we do use the iteration variable . Instead of simply adding one to the\\ncount as in the previous loop, we add the actual number (3, 41, 12, etc.) to the\\nrunning total during each loop iteration. If you think about the variable total, it\\ncontains the “running total of the values so far” . So before the loop starts total is\\nzero because we have not yet seen any values, during the loop total is the running\\ntotal, and at the end of the loop total is the overall total of all the values in the\\nlist.\\nAs the loop executes, total accumulates the sum of the elements; a variable used\\nthis way is sometimes called an accumulator.\\nNeither the counting loop nor the summing loop are particularly useful in practice\\nbecause there are built-in functionslen() and sum() that compute the number of\\nitems in a list and the total of the items in the list respectively .\\n5.6.2 Maximum and minimum loops\\nT o ﬁnd the largest value in a list or sequence, we construct the following loop:\\nlargest\\n= None\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Before:/quotesingle.ts1, largest)\\nfor itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:\\nif largest is None or itervar > largest :\\nlargest = itervar\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Loop:/quotesingle.ts1, itervar, largest)\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Largest:/quotesingle.ts1, largest)\\nWhen the program executes, the output is as follows:\\nBefore: None\\nLoop: 3 3'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 74, 'page_label': '69'}, page_content='5.6. LOOP P A TTERNS 63\\nLoop: 41 41\\nLoop: 12 41\\nLoop: 9 41\\nLoop: 74 74\\nLoop: 15 74\\nLargest: 74\\nThe variable largest is best thought of as the “largest value we have seen so far” .\\nBefore the loop, we set largest to the constant None. None is a special constant\\nvalue which we can store in a variable to mark the variable as “empty” .\\nBefore the loop starts, the largest value we have seen so far is None since we have\\nnot yet seen any values. While the loop is executing, if largest is None then we\\ntake the ﬁrst value we see as the largest so far. Y ou can see in the ﬁrst itera tion\\nwhen the value of itervar is 3, since largest is None, we immediately set largest\\nto be 3.\\nAfter the ﬁrst iteration, largest is no longer None, so the second part of the\\ncompound logical expression that checks itervar > largest triggers only when\\nwe see a value that is larger than the “largest so far” . When we see a new “even\\nlarger” value we take that new value for largest. Y ou can see in the program\\noutput that largest progresses from 3 to 41 to 74.\\nAt the end of the loop, we have scanned all of the values and the variable largest\\nnow does contain the largest value in the list.\\nT o compute the smallest number, the code is very similar with one small change:\\nsmallest\\n= None\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Before:/quotesingle.ts1, smallest)\\nfor itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:\\nif smallest is None or itervar < smallest:\\nsmallest = itervar\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Loop:/quotesingle.ts1, itervar, smallest)\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Smallest:/quotesingle.ts1, smallest)\\nAgain, smallest is the “smallest so far” before, during, and after the loop executes.\\nWhen the loop has completed, smallest contains the minimum value in the list.\\nAgain as in counting and summing, the built-in functions max() and min() make\\nwriting these exact loops unnecessary .\\nThe following is a simple version of the Python built-inmin() function:\\ndef min(values):\\nsmallest\\n= None\\nfor value in values:\\nif smallest is None or value < smallest:\\nsmallest = value\\nreturn smallest\\nIn the function version of the smallest code, we removed all of the print statements\\nso as to be equivalent to the min function which is already built in to Python.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 75, 'page_label': '70'}, page_content='64 CHAPTER 5. ITERA TION\\n5.7 Debugging\\nAs you start writing bigger programs, you might ﬁnd yourself spending more time\\ndebugging. More code means more chances to make an error and more places for\\nbugs to hide.\\nOne way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection. ” F or example, if\\nthere are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would\\ntake 100 steps.\\nInstead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program,\\nor near it, for an intermediate value you can check. Add aprint statement (or\\nsomething else that has a veriﬁable eﬀect) and run the program.\\nIf the mid-point check is incorrect, the problem must be in the ﬁrst half of the\\nprogram. If it is correct, the problem is in the second half.\\nEvery time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have\\nto search. After six steps (which is much less than 100), you would be down t o\\none or two lines of code, at least in theory .\\nIn practice it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not\\nalways possible to check it. It doesn’t make sense to count lines and ﬁnd the exact\\nmidpoint. Instead, think about places in the program where there might be errors\\nand places where it is easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think\\nthe chances are about the same that the bug is before or after the check.\\n5.8 Glossary\\naccumulatorA variable used in a loop to add up or accumulate a result.\\ncounter A variable used in a loop to count the number of times something hap-\\npened.

Since we started counting at zero, the six letters are numbered 0 to 5. T o get\\nthe last character, you have to subtract 1 fromlength:\\n>>> last = fruit[length-1]\\n>>> print(last)\\na\\nAlternatively , you can use negative indices, which count backward from the end of\\nthe string. The expression fruit[-1] yields the last letter, fruit[-2] yields the\\nsecond to last, and so on.\\n6.3 T raversal through a string with a loop\\nA lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time. Often\\nthey start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and\\ncontinue until the end. This pattern of processing is called atraversal. One way\\nto write a traversal is with a while loop:\\nindex\\n= 0\\nwhile index < len(fruit):\\nletter = fruit[index]\\nprint(letter)\\nindex\\n= index + 1'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 80, 'page_label': '75'}, page_content='6.4. STRING SLICES 69\\nThis loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. T he\\nloop condition is index < len(fruit) , so when index is equal to the length of\\nthe string, the condition is false, and the body of the loop is not executed. The\\nlast character accessed is the one with the indexlen(fruit)-1, which is the last\\ncharacter in the string.\\nExercise 1:W rite a while loop that starts at the last character in the string and\\nworks its way backwards to the ﬁrst character in the string, printing each l etter on\\na separate line, except backwards.\\nAnother way to write a traversal is with a for loop:\\nfor char in fruit:\\nprint(char)\\nEach time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned to the\\nvariable char. The loop continues until no characters are left.\\n6.4 String slices\\nA segment of a string is called a slice. Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a\\ncharacter:\\n>>> s = /quotesingle.ts1Monty Python/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> print(s[0:5])\\nMonty\\n>>> print(s[6:12])\\nPython\\nThe operator [n:m] returns the part of the string from the “n-th” character to the\\n“m-th” character, including the ﬁrst but excluding the last.\\nIf you omit the ﬁrst index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning o f\\nthe string. If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string:\\n>>> fruit = /quotesingle.ts1banana/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> fruit[:3]\\n/quotesingle.ts1ban/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> fruit[3:]\\n/quotesingle.ts1ana/quotesingle.ts1\\nIf the ﬁrst index is greater than or equal to the second the result is an empty string ,\\nrepresented by two quotation marks:\\n>>> fruit = /quotesingle.ts1banana/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> fruit[3:3]\\n/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1\\nAn empty string contains no characters and has length 0, but other than that, it\\nis the same as any other string.\\nExercise 2:Given that fruit is a string, what does fruit[:] mean?'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 81, 'page_label': '76'}, page_content='70 CHAPTER 6. STRINGS\\n6.5 Strings are immutable\\nIt is tempting to use the operator on the left side of an assignment, with the\\nintention of changing a character in a string. F or example:\\n>>> greeting = /quotesingle.ts1Hello, world!/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> greeting[0] = /quotesingle.ts1J/quotesingle.ts1\\nTypeError: /quotesingle.ts1str/quotesingle.ts1object does not support item assignment\\nThe “object” in this case is the string and the “item” is the character you tried\\nto assign. F or now, an object is the same thing as a value, but we will reﬁne that\\ndeﬁnition later. An item is one of the values in a sequence.\\nThe reason for the error is that strings are immutable, which means you can’t\\nchange an existing string. The best you can do is create a new string that is a\\nvariation on the original:\\n>>> greeting = /quotesingle.ts1Hello, world!/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> new_greeting = /quotesingle.ts1J/quotesingle.ts1+ greeting[1:]\\n>>> print(new_greeting)\\nJello, world !\\nThis example concatenates a new ﬁrst letter onto a slice of greeting.

The\\nvariable count is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time an “a” is found.\\nWhen the loop exits, count contains the result: the total number of a’s.\\nExercise 3: Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize it\\nso that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 82, 'page_label': '77'}, page_content='6.7.

Then we will ﬁnd the\\nposition of the ﬁrst space after the at-sign. And then we will use string slicing to\\nextract the portion of the string which we are looking for.\\n>>> data = /quotesingle.ts1From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> atpos = data.find(/quotesingle.ts1@/quotesingle.ts1)\\n>>> print(atpos)\\n21\\n>>> sppos = data.find(/quotesingle.ts1 /quotesingle.ts1,atpos)\\n>>> print(sppos)\\n31\\n>>> host = data[atpos+1:sppos]\\n>>> print(host)\\nuct.ac.za\\n>>>\\nW e use a version of the find method which allows us to specify a position in\\nthe string where we want find to start looking.

This is accomplished by prepending\\nanf to the string literal and enclosing expressions in curly braces {}.\\nF or example, wrapping a variable name in curly braces inside an f-string will cause\\nit to be replaced by its value:\\n>>> camels = 42\\n>>> f/quotesingle.ts1{camels}/quotesingle.ts1\\n/quotesingle.ts142/quotesingle.ts1\\nThe result is the string ‘42’, which is not to be confused with the integer value 42.\\nAn expression can appear anywhere in the string, so you can embed a value in a\\nsentence:'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 86, 'page_label': '81'}, page_content='6.12.

The\\nCPU and memory are where our software works and runs. It is where all of the\\n“thinking” happens.\\nBut if you recall from our hardware architecture discussions, once the power is\\nturned oﬀ, anything stored in either the CPU or main memory is erased. So up to\\nnow, our programs have just been transient fun exercises to learn Python.\\nIn this chapter, we start to work withSecondary Memory (or ﬁles). Secondary\\nmemory is not erased when the power is turned oﬀ.

TEXT FILES AND LINES 81\\n7.3 T ext ﬁles and lines\\nA text ﬁle can be thought of as a sequence of lines, much like a Python string can\\nbe thought of as a sequence of characters.

F or more information about the mbox\\nformat, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox.\\nT o break the ﬁle into lines, there is a special character that represents the “end of\\nthe line” called the newline character.\\nIn Python, we represent the newline character as a backslash-n in string constants.\\nEven though this looks like two characters, it is actually a single charact er. When\\nwe look at the variable by entering “stuﬀ” in the interpreter, it shows us the \\\\n\\nin the string, but when we use print to show the string, we see the string broken\\ninto two lines by the newline character.\\n>>> stuff = /quotesingle.ts1Hello\\\\nWorld!/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> stuff\\n/quotesingle.ts1Hello\\\\nWorld!/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> print(stuff)\\nHello\\nWorld\\n!\\n>>> stuff = /quotesingle.ts1X\\\\nY/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> print(stuff)\\nX\\nY\\n>>> len(stuff)\\n3\\nY ou can also see that the length of the string X\\\\nY is three characters because the\\nnewline character is a single character.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 93, 'page_label': '88'}, page_content='82 CHAPTER 7. FILES\\nSo when we look at the lines in a ﬁle, we need to imagine that there is a special\\ninvisible character called the newline at the end of each line that marks the end of\\nthe line.\\nSo the newline character separates the characters in the ﬁle into lines.\\n7.4 Reading ﬁles\\nWhile the ﬁle handle does not contain the data for the ﬁle, it is quite easy to\\nconstruct a for loop to read through and count each of the lines in a ﬁle:\\nfhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\ncount = 0\\nfor line in fhand:\\ncount = count + 1\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Line Count:/quotesingle.ts1, count)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/open.py\\nW e can use the ﬁle handle as the sequence in our for loop. Our for loop simply\\ncounts the number of lines in the ﬁle and prints them out. The rough translation\\nof thefor loop into English is, “for each line in the ﬁle represented by the ﬁle\\nhandle, add one to the count variable. ”\\nThe reason that the open function does not read the entire ﬁle is that the ﬁle might\\nbe quite large with many gigabytes of data. The open statement takes the same\\namount of time regardless of the size of the ﬁle. The for loop actually causes the\\ndata to be read from the ﬁle.\\nWhen the ﬁle is read using a for loop in this manner, Python takes care of splitting\\nthe data in the ﬁle into separate lines using the newline character. Python reads\\neach line through the newline and includes the newline as the last character in the\\nlinevariable for each iteration of the for loop.\\nBecause the for loop reads the data one line at a time, it can eﬃciently read and\\ncount the lines in very large ﬁles without running out of main memory to store\\nthe data. The above program can count the lines in any size ﬁle using very little\\nmemory since each line is read, counted, and then discarded.\\nIf you know the ﬁle is relatively small compared to the size of your main memory ,\\nyou can read the whole ﬁle into one string using the read method on the ﬁle handle.\\n>>> fhand = open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\n>>> inp = fhand.read()\\n>>> print(len(inp))\\n94626\\n>>> print(inp[:20])\\nFrom stephen.marquar\\nIn this example, the entire contents (all 94,626 characters) of the ﬁlembox-short.txt\\nare read directly into the variable inp. W e use string slicing to print out the ﬁrst\\n20 characters of the string data stored in inp.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 94, 'page_label': '89'}, page_content='7.5. SEARCHING THROUGH A FILE 83\\nWhen the ﬁle is read in this manner, all the characters including all of the lines\\nand newline characters are one big string in the variable inp. It is a good idea\\nto store the output of read as a variable because each call to read exhausts the\\nresource:\\n>>> fhand = open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\n>>> print(len(fhand.read()))\\n94626\\n>>> print(len(fhand.read()))\\n0\\nRemember that this form of the open function should only be used if the ﬁle data\\nwill ﬁt comfortably in the main memory of your computer. If the ﬁle is too lar ge\\nto ﬁt in main memory , you should write your program to read the ﬁle in chunks\\nusing afor or while loop.\\n7.5 Searching through a ﬁle\\nWhen you are searching through data in a ﬁle, it is a very common pattern to read\\nthrough a ﬁle, ignoring most of the lines and only processing lines which meet a\\nparticular condition. W e can combine the pattern for reading a ﬁle with string\\nmethods to build simple search mechanisms.\\nF or example, if we wanted to read a ﬁle and only print out lines which started with\\nthe preﬁx “F rom:”, we could use the string method startswith to select only those\\nlines with the desired preﬁx:\\nfhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfor line in fhand:\\nif line.startswith(/quotesingle.ts1From:/quotesingle.ts1):\\nprint(line)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/search1.py\\nWhen this program runs, we get the following output:\\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\\nFrom: louis@media.berkeley.edu\\nFrom: zqian@umich.edu\\nFrom: rjlowe@iupui.edu\\n...\\nThe output looks great since the only lines we are seeing are those which start wi th\\n“F rom:”, but why are we seeing the extra blank lines? This is due to that invisibl e\\nnewline character. Each of the lines ends with a newline, so the print statement'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 95, 'page_label': '90'}, page_content='84 CHAPTER 7. FILES\\nprints the string in the variable line which includes a newline and then print adds\\nanother newline, resulting in the double spacing eﬀect we see.\\nW e could use line slicing to print all but the last character, but a simpler approach\\nis to use the rstrip method which strips whitespaces from the right side of a string\\nas follows:\\nfhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfor line in fhand:\\nline = line.rstrip()\\nif line.startswith(/quotesingle.ts1From:/quotesingle.ts1):\\nprint(line)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/search2.py\\nWhen this program runs, we get the following output:\\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\\nFrom: louis@media.berkeley.edu\\nFrom: zqian@umich.edu\\nFrom: rjlowe@iupui.edu\\nFrom: zqian@umich.edu\\nFrom: rjlowe@iupui.edu\\nFrom: cwen@iupui.edu\\n...\\nAs your ﬁle processing programs get more complicated, you may want to structure\\nyour search loops using continue. The basic idea of the search loop is that you are\\nlooking for “interesting” lines and eﬀectively skipping “uninteresting” lines. And\\nthen when we ﬁnd an interesting line, we do something with that line.\\nW e can structure the loop to follow the pattern of skipping uninteresting lines as\\nfollows:\\nfhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfor line in fhand:\\nline = line.rstrip()\\n# Skip /quotesingle.ts1uninteresting lines/quotesingle.ts1\\nif not line.startswith(/quotesingle.ts1From:/quotesingle.ts1):\\ncontinue\\n# Process our /quotesingle.ts1interesting/quotesingle.ts1 line\\nprint(line)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/search3.py\\nThe output of the program is the same.

In a string, the values are characters;\\nin a list, they can be any type. The values in lists are called elements or sometimes\\nitems.\\nThere are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements\\nin square brackets (“[\" and \"]”):\\n[\\n10, 20, 30, 40]\\n[/quotesingle.ts1crunchy frog/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1ram bladder/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1lark vomit/quotesingle.ts1]\\nThe ﬁrst example is a list of four integers.

LISTS\\n8.2 Lists are mutable\\nThe syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the\\ncharacters of a string: the bracket operator. The expression inside the bracket s\\nspeciﬁes the index. Remember that the indices start at 0:\\n>>> print(cheeses[0])\\nCheddar\\nUnlike strings, lists are mutable because you can change the order of items in a\\nlist or reassign an item in a list. When the bracket operator appears on the left\\nside of an assignment, it identiﬁes the element of the list that will be assig ned.\\n>>> numbers = [17, 123]\\n>>> numbers[1] = 5\\n>>> print(numbers)\\n[17, 5]\\nThe one-th element of numbers, which used to be 123, is now 5.\\nY ou can think of a list as a relationship between indices and elements. This rela-\\ntionship is called a mapping; each index “maps to” one of the elements.\\nList indices work the same way as string indices:\\n• Any integer expression can be used as an index.\\n• If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an\\nIndexError.\\n• If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.\\nThe in operator also works on lists.\\n>>> cheeses = [/quotesingle.ts1Cheddar/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1Edam/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1Gouda/quotesingle.ts1]\\n>>> /quotesingle.ts1Edam/quotesingle.ts1in cheeses\\nTrue\\n>>> /quotesingle.ts1Brie/quotesingle.ts1in cheeses\\nFalse\\n8.3 T raversing a list\\nThe most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a for loop.

LIST OPERA TIONS 93\\nThis works well if you only need to read the elements of the list. But if you wan t\\nto write or update the elements, you need the indices. A common way to do that\\nis to combine the functionsrange and len:\\nfor i in range(len(numbers)):\\nnumbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2\\nThis loop traverses the list and updates each element. len returns the number of\\nelements in the list. range returns a list of indices from 0 to n − 1, where n is\\nthe length of the list. Each time through the loop, i gets the index of the next\\nelement. The assignment statement in the body uses i to read the old value of the\\nelement and to assign the new value.\\nA for loop over an empty list never executes the body:\\nfor x in empty:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1This never happens./quotesingle.ts1)\\nAlthough a list can contain another list, the nested list still counts as a si ngle\\nelement. The length of this list is four:\\n[\\n/quotesingle.ts1spam/quotesingle.ts1, 1, [ /quotesingle.ts1Brie/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1Roquefort/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1Pol le Veq/quotesingle.ts1], [ 1, 2, 3]]\\n8.4 List operations\\nThe + operator concatenates lists:\\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3]\\n>>> b = [4, 5, 6]\\n>>> c = a + b\\n>>> print(c)\\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\\nSimilarly , the * operator repeats a list a given number of times:\\n>>> [0] * 4\\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\\n>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3\\n[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\\nThe ﬁrst example repeats four times.

If you acciden-\\ntally write t = t.sort() , you will be disappointed with the result.\\n8.7 Deleting elements\\nThere are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the index of the\\nelement you want, you can use pop:\\n>>> t = [/quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1b/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1c/quotesingle.ts1]\\n>>> x = t.pop(1)\\n>>> print(t)\\n[/quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1c/quotesingle.ts1]\\n>>> print(x)\\nb\\npopmodiﬁes the list and returns the element that was removed. If you don’t\\nprovide an index, it deletes and returns the last element.\\nIf you don’t need the removed value, you can use thedel statement:\\n>>> t = [/quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1b/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1c/quotesingle.ts1]\\n>>> del t[1]\\n>>> print(t)\\n[/quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1c/quotesingle.ts1]\\nIf you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can use\\nremove:\\n>>> t = [/quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1b/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1c/quotesingle.ts1]\\n>>> t.remove(/quotesingle.ts1b/quotesingle.ts1)\\n>>> print(t)\\n[/quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1c/quotesingle.ts1]\\nThe return value from remove is None.\\nT o remove more than one element, you can use del with a slice index:\\n>>> t = [/quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1b/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1c/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1d/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1e/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1f/quotesingle.ts1]\\n>>> del t[1:5]\\n>>> print(t)\\n[/quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1f/quotesingle.ts1]\\nAs usual, the slice selects all the elements up to, but not including, the second\\nindex.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 107, 'page_label': '102'}, page_content='96 CHAPTER 8. LISTS\\n8.8 Lists and functions\\nThere are a number of built-in functions that can be used on lists that allow you\\nto quickly look through a list without writing your own loops:\\n>>> nums = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]\\n>>> print(len(nums))\\n6\\n>>> print(max(nums))\\n74\\n>>> print(min(nums))\\n3\\n>>> print(sum(nums))\\n154\\n>>> print(sum(nums)/len(nums))\\n25\\nThe sum() function only works when the list elements are numbers. The other\\nfunctions ( max(), len(), etc.) work with lists of strings and other types that can\\nbe comparable.\\nW e could rewrite an earlier program that computed the average of a list of numb ers\\nentered by the user using a list.\\nFirst, the program to compute an average without a list:\\ntotal\\n= 0\\ncount = 0\\nwhile (True):\\ninp = input(/quotesingle.ts1Enter a number: /quotesingle.ts1)\\nif inp == /quotesingle.ts1done/quotesingle.ts1: break\\nvalue = float(inp)\\ntotal = total + value\\ncount = count + 1\\naverage = total / count\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Average:/quotesingle.ts1, average)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/avenum.py\\nIn this program, we have count and total variables to keep the number and\\nrunning total of the user’s numbers as we repeatedly prompt the user for a number.\\nW e could simply remember each number as the user entered it and use built-in\\nfunctions to compute the sum and count at the end.\\nnumlist\\n= list()\\nwhile (True):\\ninp = input(/quotesingle.ts1Enter a number: /quotesingle.ts1)\\nif inp == /quotesingle.ts1done/quotesingle.ts1: break\\nvalue = float(inp)'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 108, 'page_label': '103'}, page_content='8.9. LISTS AND STRINGS 97\\nnumlist.append(value)\\naverage = sum(numlist) / len(numlist)\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Average:/quotesingle.ts1, average)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/avelist.py\\nW e make an empty list before the loop starts, and then each time we have a n umber,\\nwe append it to the list. At the end of the program, we simply compute the sum\\nof the numbers in the list and divide it by the count of the numbers in the list to\\ncome up with the average.\\n8.9 Lists and strings\\nA string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of values, but a list\\nof characters is not the same as a string. T o convert from a string to a lis t of\\ncharacters, you can use list:\\n>>> s = /quotesingle.ts1spam/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> t = list(s)\\n>>> print(t)\\n[/quotesingle.ts1s/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1p/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1m/quotesingle.ts1]\\nBecause list is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as\\na variable name. I also avoid the letter “l” because it looks too much like the\\nnumber “1” . So that’s why I use “t” .\\nThe list function breaks a string into individual letters. If you want to break a\\nstring into words, you can use the split method:\\n>>> s = /quotesingle.ts1pining for the fjords/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> t = s.split()\\n>>> print(t)\\n[/quotesingle.ts1pining/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1for/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1the/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1fjords/quotesingle.ts1]\\n>>> print(t[2])\\nthe\\nOnce you have usedsplit to break the string into a list of words, you can use the\\nindex operator (square bracket) to look at a particular word in the list.\\nY ou can call split with an optional argument called a delimiter that speciﬁes\\nwhich characters to use as word boundaries. The following example uses a hyphen\\nas a delimiter:\\n>>> s = /quotesingle.ts1spam-spam-spam/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> delimiter = /quotesingle.ts1-/quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> s.split(delimiter)\\n[/quotesingle.ts1spam/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1spam/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1spam/quotesingle.ts1]'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 109, 'page_label': '104'}, page_content='98 CHAPTER 8. LISTS\\njoin is the inverse of split. It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements.\\njoin is a string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list\\nas a parameter:\\n>>> t = [/quotesingle.ts1pining/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1for/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1the/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1fjords/quotesingle.ts1]\\n>>> delimiter = /quotesingle.ts1 /quotesingle.ts1\\n>>> delimiter.join(t)\\n/quotesingle.ts1pining for the fjords/quotesingle.ts1\\nIn this case the delimiter is a space character, so join puts a space between words.\\nT o concatenate strings without spaces, you can use the empty string, \"\", as a\\ndelimiter.\\n8.10 Parsing lines\\nUsually when we are reading a ﬁle we want to do something to the lines other than\\njust printing the whole line. Often we want to ﬁnd the “interesting lines” and then\\nparsethe line to ﬁnd some interesting part of the line. What if we wanted to print\\nout the day of the week from those lines that start with “F rom”?\\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008\\nThe split method is very eﬀective when faced with this kind of problem.

In this example,\\nthere are two references to the same object.\\nAn object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that\\nthe object is aliased.\\nIf the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias aﬀect the other:\\n>>> b[0] = 17\\n>>> print(a)\\n[17, 2, 3]\\nAlthough this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general, it is safer to\\navoid aliasing when you are working with mutable objects.\\nF or immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a problem.

If\\nthe function modiﬁes a list parameter, the caller sees the change.

LIST ARGUMENTS 101\\nThe parameter t and the variable letters are aliases for the same object.\\nIt is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and o perations\\nthat create new lists. F or example, the append method modiﬁes a list, but the +\\noperator creates a new list:\\n>>> t1 = [1, 2]\\n>>> t2 = t1.append(3)\\n>>> print(t1)\\n[1, 2, 3]\\n>>> print(t2)\\nNone\\n>>> t3 = t1 + [3]\\n>>> print(t3)\\n[1, 2, 3]\\n>>> t1 is t3\\nFalse\\nThis diﬀerence is important when you write functions that are supposed to modify\\nlists. F or example, this function does not delete the head of a list:\\ndef bad_delete_head(t):\\nt\\n= t[1:] # WRONG!\\nThe slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes t refer to it, but\\nnone of that has any eﬀect on the list that was passed as an argument.\\nAn alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. F or\\nexample, tail returns all but the ﬁrst element of a list:\\ndef tail(t):\\nreturn t[1:]\\nThis function leaves the original list unmodiﬁed. Here’s how it is used:\\n>>> letters = [/quotesingle.ts1a/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1b/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1c/quotesingle.ts1]\\n>>> rest = tail(letters)\\n>>> print(rest)\\n[/quotesingle.ts1b/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1c/quotesingle.ts1]\\nExercise 1: W rite a function called chop that takes a list and modiﬁes it, removing\\nthe ﬁrst and last elements, and returns None.

LISTS\\n8.14 Debugging\\nCareless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging.\\nHere are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:\\n1. Don’t forget that most list methods modify the argument and return None.\\nThis is the opposite of the string methods, which return a new string and\\nleave the original alone.\\nIf you are used to writing string code like this:\\nword\\n= word.strip()\\nIt is tempting to write list code like this:\\nt\\n= t.sort() # WRONG!\\nBecause sort returns None, the next operation you perform with t is likely\\nto fail.\\nBefore using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation\\ncarefully and then test them in interactive mode. The methods and operators\\nthat lists share with other sequences (like strings) are documented at:\\ndocs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations\\nThe methods and operators that only apply to mutable sequences are docu-\\nmented at:\\ndocs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types\\n2. Pick an idiom and stick with it.\\nPart of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things.\\nF or example, to remove an element from a list, you can usepop, remove, del,\\nor even a slice assignment.\\nT o add an element, you can use the append method or the + operator. But\\ndon’t forget that these are right:\\nt.append(x)\\nt\\n= t + [x]\\nAnd these are wrong:\\nt.append([x]) # WRONG!\\nt = t.append(x) # WRONG!\\nt + [x] # WRONG!\\nt = t + x # WRONG!\\nT ry out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you under-\\nstand what they do. Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error;\\nthe other three are legal, but they do the wrong thing.\\n3. Make copies to avoid aliasing.\\nIf you want to use a method like sort that modiﬁes the argument, but you\\nneed to keep the original list as well, you can make a copy .'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 114, 'page_label': '109'}, page_content='8.14.

But in that case you should\\navoid usingsorted as a variable name!\\n4. Lists, split, and ﬁles\\nWhen we read and parse ﬁles, there are many opportunities to encounter\\ninput that can crash our program so it is a good idea to revisit the guardian\\npattern when it comes to writing programs that read through a ﬁle and look\\nfor a “needle in the haystack” .\\nLet’s revisit our program that is looking for the day of the week on the from\\nlines of our ﬁle:\\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008\\nSince we are breaking this line into words, we could dispense with the use\\nofstartswith and simply look at the ﬁrst word of the line to determine if\\nwe are interested in the line at all.

What messed-up\\ndata caused our elegant, clever, and very Pythonic program to fail?\\nY ou could stare at it for a long time and puzzle through it or ask someone\\nfor help, but the quicker and smarter approach is to add a print statement.\\nThe best place to add the print statement is right before the line where the\\nprogram failed and print out the data that seems to be causing the failure.\\nNow this approach may generate a lot of lines of output, but at least you will\\nimmediately have some clue as to the problem at hand.

Each key maps to a value. The association of a\\nkey and a value is called a key-value pair or sometimes an item.\\nAs an example, we’ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words,\\nso the keys and the values are all strings.\\nThe function dict creates a new dictionary with no items. Because dict is the\\nname of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.\\n>>> eng2sp = dict()\\n>>> print(eng2sp)\\n{}\\nThe curly brackets, {}, represent an empty dictionary . T o add items to the dictio-\\nnary , you can use square brackets:\\n>>> eng2sp[/quotesingle.ts1one/quotesingle.ts1] = /quotesingle.ts1uno/quotesingle.ts1\\nThis line creates an item that maps from the key /quotesingle.ts1one/quotesingle.ts1to the value “uno” .

DICTIONARIES\\nSince Python 3.7x the order of key-value pairs is the same as their input order,\\ni.e. dictionaries are now ordered structures.\\nBut that doesn’t really matter because the elements of a dictionary are never\\nindexed with integer indices.

Then you can use the in\\noperator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary .\\n9.1 Dictionary as a set of counters\\nSuppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter\\nappears. There are several ways you could do it:\\n1. Y ou could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you\\ncould traverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding\\ncounter, probably using a chained conditional.\\n2. Y ou could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each char-\\nacter to a number (using the built-in function ord), use the number as an\\nindex into the list, and increment the appropriate counter.\\n3. Y ou could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the\\ncorresponding values. The ﬁrst time you see a character, you would add\\nan item to the dictionary . After that you would increment the value of an\\nexisting item.\\nEach of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements\\nthat computation in a diﬀerent way .\\nAn implementation is a way of performing a computation; some implementations\\nare better than others. F or example, an advantage of the dictionary implementa -\\ntion is that we don’t have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the str ing\\nand we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.\\nHere is what the code might look like:\\nword\\n= /quotesingle.ts1brontosaurus/quotesingle.ts1\\nd = dict()\\nfor c in word:\\nif c not in d:\\nd[c] = 1\\nelse:\\nd[c]\\n= d[c] + 1\\nprint(d)\\nW e are eﬀectively computing a histogram, which is a statistical term for a set of\\ncounters (or frequencies).\\nThe for loop traverses the string.

So you should take a moment and compare the loop using the if statement\\nand in operator with the loop using the get method. They do exactly the same\\nthing, but one is more succinct.\\n9.2 Dictionaries and ﬁles\\nOne of the common uses of a dictionary is to count the occurrence of words in a\\nﬁle with some written text. Let’s start with a very simple ﬁle of words taken from\\nthe text of Romeo and Juliet .\\nF or the ﬁrst set of examples, we will use a shortened and simpliﬁed version of\\nthe text with no punctuation.

DICTIONARIES AND FILES 113\\nY ou will see that we have two for loops.

This is an example of a pattern callednested loops because one of the loops\\nis the outer loop and the other loop is the inner loop.\\nBecause the inner loop executes all of its iterations each time the outer loop makes\\na single iteration, we think of the inner loop as iterating “more quickly” and the\\nouter loop as iterating more slowly .\\nThe combination of the two nested loops ensures that we will count every word on\\nevery line of the input ﬁle.\\nfname\\n= input(/quotesingle.ts1Enter the file name: /quotesingle.ts1)\\ntry:\\nfhand = open(fname)\\nexcept:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1File cannot be opened:/quotesingle.ts1, fname)\\nexit()\\ncounts = dict()\\nfor line in fhand:\\nwords = line.split()\\nfor word in words:\\nif word not in counts:\\ncounts[word] = 1\\nelse:\\ncounts[word] += 1\\nprint(counts)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/count1.py\\nIn our else statement, we use the more compact alternative for incrementing a\\nvariable. counts[word] += 1 is equivalent to counts[word] = counts[word] +\\n1.

LIST COMPREHENSION 127\\nIn many contexts, the diﬀerent kinds of sequences (strings, lists, and tuples) can\\nbe used interchangeably . So how and why do you choose one over the others?\\nT o start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other sequences becaus e\\nthe elements have to be characters. They are also immutable. If you need the\\nability to change the characters in a string (as opposed to creating a new string),\\nyou might want to use a list of characters instead.\\nLists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable. But there\\nare a few cases where you might prefer tuples:\\n1. In some contexts, like a return statement, it is syntactically simpler to create\\na tuple than a list. In other contexts, you might prefer a list.\\n2. If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key , you have to use an im-\\nmutable type like a tuple or string.\\n3. If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples\\nreduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.\\nBecause tuples are immutable, they don’t provide methods like sort and reverse,\\nwhich modify existing lists. However Python provides the built-in functions sorted\\nand reversed, which take any sequence as a parameter and return a new sequence\\nwith the same elements in a diﬀerent order.\\n10.9 List comprehension\\nSometimes you want to create a sequence by using data from another sequence.\\nY ou can achieve this by writing a for loop and appending one item at a time. F or\\nexample, if you wanted to convert a list of strings – each string storing di gits – into\\nnumbers that you can sum up, you would write:\\nlist_of_ints_in_strings\\n= [/quotesingle.ts142/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts165/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts112/quotesingle.ts1]\\nlist_of_ints = []\\nfor x in list_of_ints_in_strings:\\nlist_of_ints.append(int(x))\\nprint(sum(list_of_ints))\\nWith list comprehension, the above code can be written in a more compact manner:\\nlist_of_ints_in_strings = [/quotesingle.ts142/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts165/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts112/quotesingle.ts1]\\nlist_of_ints = [ int(x) for x in list_of_ints_in_strings ]\\nprint(sum(list_of_ints))'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 139, 'page_label': '134'}, page_content='128 CHAPTER 10.

W e have been using string methods\\nlike split and find and using lists and string slicing to extract portions of the\\nlines.\\nThis task of searching and extracting is so common that Python has a very power ful\\nmodule called regular expressions that handles many of these tasks quite elegantly .\\nThe reason we have not introduced regular expressions earlier in the book is because\\nwhile they are very powerful, they are a little complicated and their syntax takes\\nsome getting used to.\\nRegular expressions are almost their own little programming language forsearching\\nand parsing strings. As a matter of fact, entire books have been written on the\\ntopic of regular expressions. In this chapter, we will only cover the basics of reg ular\\nexpressions. F or more detail on regular expressions, see:\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\\nhttps://docs.python.org/library/re.html\\nThe regular expression module re must be imported into your program before you\\ncan use it. The simplest use of the regular expression module is the search()\\nfunction. The following program demonstrates a trivial use of the search functi on.\\n# Search for lines that contain /quotesingle.ts1From/quotesingle.ts1\\nimport re\\nhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfor line in hand:\\nline = line.rstrip()\\nif re.search(/quotesingle.ts1From:/quotesingle.ts1, line):\\nprint(line)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re01.py\\nW e open the ﬁle, loop through each line, and use the regular expression search()\\nto only print out lines that contain the string “F rom:” . This program does not\\n131'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 143, 'page_label': '138'}, page_content='132 CHAPTER 11. REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\\nuse the real power of regular expressions, since we could have just as easily used\\nline.find()to accomplish the same result.\\nThe power of the regular expressions comes when we add special characters to\\nthe search string that allow us to more precisely control which lines match t he\\nstring. Adding these special characters to our regular expression allow us to do\\nsophisticated matching and extraction while writing very little code.\\nF or example, the caret character is used in regular expressions to match “the\\nbeginning” of a line. W e could change our program to only match lines where\\n“F rom:” was at the beginning of the line as follows:\\n# Search for lines that start with /quotesingle.ts1From/quotesingle.ts1\\nimport re\\nhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfor line in hand:\\nline = line.rstrip()\\nif re.search(/quotesingle.ts1ˆFrom:/quotesingle.ts1, line):\\nprint(line)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re02.py\\nNow we will only match lines that start with the string “F rom:” . This is still a\\nvery simple example that we could have done equivalently with the startswith()\\nmethod from the string module. But it serves to introduce the notion that regular\\nexpressions contain special action characters that give us more control as to what\\nwill match the regular expression.\\n11.1 Character matching in regular expressions\\nThere are a number of other special characters that let us build even more powerful\\nregular expressions. The most commonly used special character is the period or\\nfull stop, which matches any character.\\nIn the following example, the regular expressionF..m: would match any of the\\nstrings “F rom:”, “Fxxm:”, “F12m:”, or “F!@m:” since the period char acters in the\\nregular expression match any character.\\n# Search for lines that start with /quotesingle.ts1F/quotesingle.ts1, followed by\\n# 2 characters, followed by /quotesingle.ts1m:/quotesingle.ts1\\nimport re\\nhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfor line in hand:\\nline = line.rstrip()\\nif re.search(/quotesingle.ts1ˆF..m:/quotesingle.ts1, line):\\nprint(line)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re03.py'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 144, 'page_label': '139'}, page_content='11.2. EXTRACTING DA T A USING REGULAR EXPRESSIONS 133\\nThis is particularly powerful when combined with the ability to indicate that a\\ncharacter can be repeated any number of times using the * or + characters in your\\nregular expression. These special characters mean that instead of matching a singl e\\ncharacter in the search string, they match zero-or-more characters (in the case of\\nthe asterisk) or one-or-more of the characters (in the case of the plus sign).\\nW e can further narrow down the lines that we match using a repeated wild card\\ncharacter in the following example:\\n# Search for lines that start with From and have an at sign\\nimport re\\nhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfor line in hand:\\nline = line.rstrip()\\nif re.search(/quotesingle.ts1ˆFrom:.+@/quotesingle.ts1, line):\\nprint(line)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re04.py\\nThe search string ˆFrom:.+@ will successfully match lines that start with “F rom:”,\\nfollowed by one or more characters ( .+), followed by an at-sign. So this will match\\nthe following line:\\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\\nY ou can think of the .+ wildcard as expanding to match all the characters between\\nthe colon character and the at-sign.\\nFrom:.+@\\nIt is good to think of the plus and asterisk characters as “pushy” . F or example,\\nthe following string would match the last at-sign in the string as the.+ pushes\\noutwards, as shown below:\\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za, csev@umich.edu, and cwen @iupui.edu\\nIt is possible to tell an asterisk or plus sign not to be so “greedy” by adding\\nanother character. See the detailed documentation for information on turning oﬀ\\nthe greedy behavior.\\n11.2 Extracting data using regular expressions\\nIf we want to extract data from a string in Python we can use thefindall()\\nmethod to extract all of the substrings which match a regular expression.

The number can include a decimal.\\n# Then print the number if it is greater than zero.\\nimport re\\nhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfor line in hand:\\nline = line.rstrip()\\nx = re.findall(r/quotesingle.ts1ˆX\\\\S*: ([0-9.]+)/quotesingle.ts1, line)\\nif len(x) > 0:\\nprint(x)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re11.py\\nInstead of calling search(), we add parentheses around the part of the regular\\nexpression that represents the ﬂoating-point number to indicate we only want\\nfindall()to give us back the ﬂoating-point number portion of the matching\\nstring.\\nThe output from this program is as follows:\\n[/quotesingle.ts10.8475/quotesingle.ts1]\\n[/quotesingle.ts10.0000/quotesingle.ts1]\\n[/quotesingle.ts10.6178/quotesingle.ts1]'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 149, 'page_label': '144'}, page_content='138 CHAPTER 11.

This “greedy” behavior i s why we\\nget all ﬁve digits for each number. The regular expression module expands in both\\ndirections until it encounters a non-digit, or the beginning or the end of a line.\\nNow we can use regular expressions to redo an exercise from earlier in the book\\nwhere we were interested in the time of day of each mail message.

COMBINING SEARCHING AND EXTRACTING 139\\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008\\nand wanted to extract the hour of the day for each line. Previously we did this\\nwith two calls to split. First the line was split into words and then we pulled\\nout the ﬁfth word and split it again on the colon character to pull out the two\\ncharacters we were interested in.\\nWhile this worked, it actually results in pretty brittle code that is assuming t he\\nlines are nicely formatted. If you were to add enough error checking (or a big\\ntry/except block) to insure that your program never failed when presented with\\nincorrectly formatted lines, the code would balloon to 10-15 lines of code that was\\npretty hard to read.\\nW e can do this in a far simpler way with the following regular expression:\\n^From .* [0-9][0-9]:\\nThe translation of this regular expression is that we are looking for lines that start\\nwith From (note the space), followed by any number of characters ( .*), followed by\\na space, followed by two digits [0-9][0-9], followed by a colon character. This is\\nthe deﬁnition of the kinds of lines we are looking for.\\nIn order to pull out only the hour usingfindall(), we add parentheses around\\nthe two digits as follows:\\n^From .* ([0-9][0-9]):\\nThis results in the following program:\\n# Search for lines that start with From and a character\\n# followed by a two digit number between 00 and 99 followed by /quotesingle.ts1:/quotesingle.ts1\\n# Then print the number if one is found\\nimport re\\nhand\\n= open(/quotesingle.ts1mbox-short.txt/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfor line in hand:\\nline = line.rstrip()\\nx = re.findall(/quotesingle.ts1ˆFrom .* ([0-9][0-9]):/quotesingle.ts1, line)\\nif len(x) > 0: print(x)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re13.py\\nWhen the program runs, it produces the following output:\\n[/quotesingle.ts109/quotesingle.ts1]\\n[/quotesingle.ts118/quotesingle.ts1]\\n[/quotesingle.ts116/quotesingle.ts1]\\n[/quotesingle.ts115/quotesingle.ts1]\\n...'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 151, 'page_label': '146'}, page_content='140 CHAPTER 11. REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\\n11.4 Escape character\\nSince we use special characters in regular expressions to match the beginning or\\nend of a line or specify wild cards, we need a way to indicate that these characters\\nare “normal” and we want to match the actual character such as a dollar sign or\\ncaret.\\nW e can indicate that we want to simply match a character by preﬁxing that charac-\\nter with a backslash. F or example, we can ﬁnd money amounts with the following\\nregular expression.\\nimport re\\nx\\n= /quotesingle.ts1We just received $10.00 for cookies./quotesingle.ts1\\ny = re.findall(/quotesingle.ts1\\\\$[0-9.]+/quotesingle.ts1,x)\\nSince we preﬁx the dollar sign with a backslash, it actually matches the dollar\\nsign in the input string instead of matching the “end of line”, and the rest of\\nthe regular expression matches one or more digits or the period character.Note:\\nInside square brackets, characters are not “special” . So when we say [0-9.], it\\nreally means digits or a period. Outside of square brackets, a period is the “w ild-\\ncard” character and matches any character. Inside square brackets, the period is\\na period.\\n11.5 Summary\\nWhile this only scratched the surface of regular expressions, we have learned a bit\\nabout the language of regular expressions. They are search strings with specia l\\ncharacters in them that communicate your wishes to the regular expression system\\nas to what deﬁnes “matching” and what is extracted from the matched strings.\\nHere are some of those special characters and character sequences:\\nˆMatches the beginning of the line.\\n$ Matches the end of the line.\\n. Matches any character (a wildcard).\\n\\\\s Matches a whitespace character.\\n\\\\S Matches a non-whitespace character (opposite of \\\\s).\\n* Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero\\nor more times.\\n*?Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero\\nor more times in “non-greedy mode” .\\n+Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match one or\\nmore times.\\n+?Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match one\\nor more times in “non-greedy mode” .'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 152, 'page_label': '147'}, page_content='11.6.

Then we will read through the web page\\ndata and parse it.\\n12.1 Hypertext T ransfer Protocol - HTTP\\nThe network protocol that powers the web is actually quite simple and there is\\nbuilt-in support in Python called socket which makes it very easy to make network\\nconnections and retrieve data over those sockets in a Python program.\\nA socket is much like a ﬁle, except that a single socket provides a two-way connec-\\ntion between two programs. Y ou can both read from and write to the same s ocket.\\nIf you write something to a socket, it is sent to the application at the other end\\nof the socket. If you read from the socket, you are given the data which the other\\napplication has sent.\\nBut if you try to read a socket\\n1 when the program on the other end of the socket\\nhas not sent any data, you just sit and wait. If the programs on both ends of\\nthe socket simply wait for some data without sending anything, they will waitfor\\na very long time, so an important part of programs that communicate over the\\nInternet is to have some sort of protocol.\\nA protocol is a set of precise rules that determine who is to go ﬁrst, what they are\\nto do, and then what the responses are to that message, and who sends next, and\\nso on. In a sense the two applications at either end of the socket are doing a dance\\nand making sure not to step on each other’s toes.\\nThere are many documents that describe these network protocols. The Hypertext\\nT ransfer Protocol is described in the following document:\\n1 If you want to learn more about sockets, protocols or how web s ervers are developed, you\\ncan explore the course at https://www.dj4e.com.\\n145'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 157, 'page_label': '152'}, page_content='146 CHAPTER 12.

But if you take a look around page 3 6 of\\nRFC2616 you will ﬁnd the syntax for the GET request. T o request a document\\nfrom a web server, we make a connection, e.g. to thewww.pr4e.org server on port\\n80, and then send a line of the form\\nGET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\\nwhere the second parameter is the web page we are requesting, and then we also\\nsend a blank line. The web server will respond with some header information about\\nthe document and a blank line followed by the document content.\\n12.2 The world’s simplest web browser\\nPerhaps the easiest way to show how the HTTP protocol works is to write a very\\nsimple Python program that makes a connection to a web server and follows the\\nrules of the HTTP protocol to request a document and display what the server\\nsends back.\\nimport socket\\nmysock\\n= socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\\nmysock.connect((/quotesingle.ts1data.pr4e.org/quotesingle.ts1, 80))\\ncmd = /quotesingle.ts1GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n/quotesingle.ts1.encode()\\nmysock.send(cmd)\\nwhile True:\\ndata = mysock.recv(512)\\nif len(data) < 1:\\nbreak\\nprint(data.decode(),end=/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1)\\nmysock.close()\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/socket1.py\\nFirst the program makes a connection to port 80 on the server www.pr4e.com.\\nSince our program is playing the role of the “web browser”, the HTTP protocol\\nsays we must send the GET command followed by a blank line.\\\\r\\\\n signiﬁes\\nan EOL (end of line), so \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n signiﬁes nothing between two EOL sequences.\\nThat is the equivalent of a blank line.\\nOnce we send that blank line, we write a loop that receives data in 512-character\\nchunks from the socket and prints the data out until there is no more data to read\\n(i.e., the recv() returns an empty string).\\nThe program produces the following output:\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 158, 'page_label': '153'}, page_content='12.2.

The data in these ﬁles is generally not useful to print out, but you can\\neasily make a copy of a URL to a local ﬁle on your hard disk using urllib.\\nThe pattern is to open the URL and use read to download the entire contents of\\nthe document into a string variable ( img) then write that information to a local\\nﬁle as follows:\\nimport urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error\\nimg\\n= urllib.request.urlopen(/quotesingle.ts1http://data.pr4e.org/cover3.jpg/quotesingle.ts1).read()\\nfhand = open(/quotesingle.ts1cover3.jpg/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1wb/quotesingle.ts1)\\nfhand.write(img)\\nfhand.close()\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/curl1.py\\nThis program reads all of the data in at once across the network and stores it in the\\nvariable img in the main memory of your computer, then opens the ﬁle cover.jpg\\nand writes the data out to your disk. The wb argument for open() opens a binary\\nﬁle for writing only . This program will work if the size of the ﬁle is less t han the\\nsize of the memory of your computer.\\nHowever if this is a large audio or video ﬁle, this program may crash or at least\\nrun extremely slowly when your computer runs out of memory .

Using this technique, Google spiders its way through nearly all of the\\npages on the web.\\nGoogle also uses the frequency of links from pages it ﬁnds to a particular page as\\none measure of how “important” a page is and how high the page should appear\\nin its search results.\\n12.7 Parsing HTML using regular expressions\\nOne simple way to parse HTML is to use regular expressions to repeatedly search\\nfor and extract substrings that match a particular pattern.\\nHere is a simple web page:'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 164, 'page_label': '159'}, page_content='12.7.

The question mark behind the [s]? indicates to search for the\\nstring “http” followed by zero or one “s” .\\nThe question mark added to the .+? indicates that the match is to be done in\\na “non-greedy” fashion instead of a “greedy” fashion. A non-greedy match tries\\nto ﬁnd thesmal lest possible matching string and a greedy match tries to ﬁnd the\\nlargest possible matching string.\\nW e add parentheses to our regular expression to indicate which part of our matched\\nstring we would like to extract, and produce the following program:\\n# Search for link values within URL input\\nimport urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error\\nimport re\\nimport ssl\\n# Ignore SSL certificate errors\\nctx = ssl.create_default_context()\\nctx.check_hostname = False\\nctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE\\nurl = input(/quotesingle.ts1Enter - /quotesingle.ts1)\\nhtml = urllib.request.urlopen(url, context =ctx).read()\\nlinks = re.findall(b/quotesingle.ts1href=\"(http[s]?://.*?)\"/quotesingle.ts1, html)\\nfor link in links:\\nprint(link.decode())\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/urlregex.py\\nThe ssl library allows this program to access web sites that strictly enforce HTTPS.\\nThe read method returns HTML source code as a bytes object instead of returning\\nan HTTPResponse object.

But since Python was invented before JavaScript, Python’s\\nsyntax for dictionaries and lists inﬂuenced the syntax of JSON. So the format of\\nJSON is nearly identical to a combination of Python lists and dictionaries.\\nHere is a JSON encoding that is roughly equivalent to the simple XML from above:\\n{\\n\"name\" : \"Chuck\",\\n\"phone\" : {\\n\"type\" : \"intl\",\\n\"number\" : \"+1 734 303 4456\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 174, 'page_label': '169'}, page_content='13.5. P ARSING JSON 163\\n},\\n\"email\" : {\\n\"hide\" : \"yes\"\\n}\\n}\\nY ou will notice some diﬀerences. First, in XML, we can add attributes like “i ntl”\\nto the “phone” tag. In JSON, we simply have key-value pairs. Also the XML\\n“person” tag is gone, replaced by a set of outer curly braces.\\nIn general, JSON structures are simpler than XML because JSON has fewer ca-\\npabilities than XML. But JSON has the advantage that it mapsdirectly to some\\ncombination of dictionaries and lists. And since nearly all programming langua ges\\nhave something equivalent to Python’s dictionaries and lists, JSON is a very nat-\\nural format to have two cooperating programs exchange data.\\nJSON is quickly becoming the format of choice for nearly all data exchange between\\napplications because of its relative simplicity compared to XML.\\n13.5 Parsing JSON\\nW e construct our JSON by nesting dictionaries and lists as needed. In this example,\\nwe represent a list of users where each user is a set of key-value pairs (i.e., a\\ndictionary). So we have a list of dictionaries.\\nIn the following program, we use the built-injson library to parse the JSON and\\nread through the data. Compare this closely to the equivalent XML data and code\\nabove. The JSON has less detail, so we must know in advance that we are getting a\\nlist and that the list is of users and each user is a set of key-value pairs. The JSON\\nis more succinct (an advantage) but also is less self-describing (a disadvantage).\\nimport json\\ndata\\n= /quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1\\n[\\n{ \"id\" : \"001\",\\n\"x\" : \"2\",\\n\"name\" : \"Chuck\"\\n} ,\\n{ \"id\" : \"009\",\\n\"x\" : \"7\",\\n\"name\" : \"Brent\"\\n}\\n]/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1\\ninfo = json.loads(data)\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1User count:/quotesingle.ts1, len(info))\\nfor item in info:\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1Name/quotesingle.ts1, item[ /quotesingle.ts1name/quotesingle.ts1])'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 175, 'page_label': '170'}, page_content='164 CHAPTER 13.

Once the JSON\\nhas been parsed, we can use the Python index operator to extract the various bits\\nof data for each user.

Because the JSON is simpler and more directly maps to native data struc-\\ntures we already have in programming languages, the parsing and data extraction\\ncode is usually simpler and more direct when using JSON. But XML is more self-\\ndescriptive than JSON and so there are some applications where XML retains an\\nadvantage. F or example, most word processors store documents internally using\\nXML rather than JSON.\\n13.6 Application Programming Interfaces\\nW e now have the ability to exchange data between applications using Hypertext\\nT ransport Protocol (HTTP) and a way to represent complex data that we are send-\\ning back and forth between these applications using eXtensible Markup Language\\n(XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).\\nThe next step is to begin to deﬁne and document “contracts” between applications\\nusing these techniques. The general name for these application-to-application con-\\ntracts isApplication Program Interfaces (APIs). When we use an API, generally\\none program makes a set of services available for use by other applications and\\npublishes the APIs (i.e., the “rules”) that must be followed to access the services\\nprovided by the program.\\nWhen we begin to build our programs where the functionality of our program\\nincludes access to services provided by other programs, we call the approach a\\nService-oriented architecture (SOA). An SOA approach is one where our overall\\napplication makes use of the services of other applications. A non-SOA approach\\nis where the application is a single standalone application which contains allof the\\ncode necessary to implement the application.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 176, 'page_label': '171'}, page_content='13.7.

W e can go to a single web\\nsite and book air travel, hotels, and automobiles all from a single site. The data\\nfor hotels is not stored on the airline computers. Instead, the airline computers\\ncontact the services on the hotel computers and retrieve the hotel data and present\\nit to the user. When the user agrees to make a hotel reservation using the airline\\nsite, the airline site uses another web service on the hotel systems to actually make\\nthe reservation. And when it comes time to charge your credit card for the whole\\ntransaction, still other computers become involved in the process.\\nA Service-oriented architecture has many advantages, including: (1) we always\\nmaintain only one copy of data (this is particularly important for thing s like hotel\\nreservations where we do not want to over-commit) and (2) the owners of the data\\ncan set the rules about the use of their data. With these advantages, an SOA\\nsystem must be carefully designed to have good performance and meet the user’s\\nneeds.\\nWhen an application makes a set of services in its API available over the web, we\\ncall these web services .\\n13.7 Security and API usage\\nIt is quite common that you need an API key to make use of a vendor’s API. The\\ngeneral idea is that they want to know who is using their services and how much\\neach user is using. Perhaps they have free and pay tiers of their services or have a\\npolicy that limits the number of requests that a single individual can make during\\na particular time period.\\nSometimes once you get your API key , you simply include the key as part of POST\\ndata or perhaps as a parameter on the URL when calling the API.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 177, 'page_label': '172'}, page_content='166 CHAPTER 13.

Y ou should approach\\nthis chapter as a way to learn some terms and concepts and work through a few\\nsimple examples to lay a foundation for future learning.\\nThe key outcome of this chapter is to have a basic understanding of how objects\\nare constructed and how they function and most importantly how we make use of\\nthe capabilities of objects that are provided to us by Python and Python libraries.\\n14.3 Using objects\\nAs it turns out, we have been using objects all along in this book. Python provi des\\nus with many built-in objects. Here is some simple code where the ﬁrst few lines\\nshould feel very simple and natural to you.\\nstuff\\n= list()\\nstuff.append(/quotesingle.ts1python/quotesingle.ts1)\\nstuff.append(/quotesingle.ts1chuck/quotesingle.ts1)\\nstuff.sort()\\nprint (stuff[\\n0])\\nprint (stuff. __getitem__(0))\\nprint (list. __getitem__(stuff,0))\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/objects.py\\nInstead of focusing on what these lines accomplish, let’s look at what is really\\nhappening from the point of view of object-oriented programming. Don’t worry\\nif the following paragraphs don’t make any sense the ﬁrst time you read them\\nbecause we have not yet deﬁned all of these terms.\\nThe ﬁrst line constructs an object of type list, the second and third lines cal l\\nthe append() method, the fourth line calls the sort() method, and the ﬁfth line\\nretrieves the item at position 0.\\nThe sixth line calls the __getitem__() method in the stuff list with a parameter\\nof zero.\\nprint (stuff.\\n__getitem__(0))\\nThe seventh line is an even more verbose way of retrieving the 0th item in the l ist.\\nprint (list. __getitem__(stuff,0))\\nIn this code, we call the __getitem__ method in the list class and pass the list\\nand the item we want retrieved from the list as parameters.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 180, 'page_label': '175'}, page_content='14.4.

The input and output aspects are where the program interacts with the\\noutside world. Within the program we have code and data to accomplish the task\\nthe program is designed to solve.\\nOne way to think about object-oriented programming is that it separates our pro-\\ngram into multiple “zones. ” Each zone contains some code and data (like a pro-\\ngram) and has well deﬁned interactions with the outside world and the other zones\\nwithin the program.\\nIf we look back at the link extraction application where we used the BeautifulSoup\\nlibrary , we can see a program that is constructed by connecting diﬀerent objects\\ntogether to accomplish a task:'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 181, 'page_label': '176'}, page_content='170 CHAPTER 14.

This allows us\\nto focus on the part of the problem we need to solve and ignore the other parts of\\nthe program.\\nThis ability to focus exclusively on the part of a program that we care about and\\nignore the rest is also helpful to the developers of the objects that we use.

It looks like a function call to the class itself. Python\\nconstructs the object with the right data and methods and returns the object which\\nis then assigned to the variablean. In a way this is quite similar to the following\\nline which we have been using all along:\\ncounts\\n= dict()\\nHere we instruct Python to construct an object using the dict template (already\\npresent in Python), return the instance of dictionary , and assign it to the vari able\\ncounts.\\nWhen the PartyAnimal class is used to construct an object, the variable an is used\\nto point to that object.

When the program\\nﬁnishes, all of the variables are discarded. Usually , we don’t think much about\\nthe creation and destruction of variables, but often as our objects become more\\ncomplex, we need to take some action within the object to set things up as the\\nobject is constructed and possibly clean things up as the object is discarded.\\nIf we want our object to be aware of these moments of construction and destruction,\\nwe add specially named methods to our object:\\nclass PartyAnimal:\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.x = 0\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1I am constructed/quotesingle.ts1)\\ndef party(self) :\\nself.x = self.x + 1\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1So far/quotesingle.ts1,self.x)\\ndef __del__(self):\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1I am destructed/quotesingle.ts1, self.x)\\nan = PartyAnimal()\\nan.party()\\nan.party()\\nan\\n= 42\\nprint(/quotesingle.ts1an contains/quotesingle.ts1,an)\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/party4.py\\nWhen this program executes, it produces the following output:\\nI am constructed\\nSo far 1\\nSo far 2\\nI am destructed 2\\nan contains 42'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 187, 'page_label': '182'}, page_content='176 CHAPTER 14. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING\\nAs Python constructs our object, it calls our __init__ method to give us a chance\\nto set up some default or initial values for the object. When Python encounters\\nthe line:\\nan = 42\\nIt actually “throws our object away” so it can reuse thean variable to store the\\nvalue 42. Just at the moment when our an object is being “destroyed” our destruc-\\ntor code ( __del__) is called. W e cannot stop our variable from being destroyed,\\nbut we can do any necessary cleanup right before our object no longer exists.\\nWhen developing objects, it is quite common to add a constructor to an object to\\nset up initial values for the object. It is relatively rare to need a destructor fo r an\\nobject.\\n14.9 Multiple instances\\nSo far, we have deﬁned a class, constructed a single object, used that object,\\nand then thrown the object away . However, the real power in object-oriented\\nprogramming happens when we construct multiple instances of our class.\\nWhen we construct multiple objects from our class, we might want to set up dif-\\nferent initial values for each of the objects. W e can pass data to the constructor s\\nto give each object a diﬀerent initial value:\\nclass PartyAnimal:\\ndef __init__(self, nam):\\nself.x = 0\\nself.name = nam\\nprint(self.name,/quotesingle.ts1constructed/quotesingle.ts1)\\ndef party(self) :\\nself.x = self.x + 1\\nprint(self.name,/quotesingle.ts1party count/quotesingle.ts1,self.x)\\ns = PartyAnimal(/quotesingle.ts1Sally/quotesingle.ts1)\\ns.party()\\nj\\n= PartyAnimal(/quotesingle.ts1Jim/quotesingle.ts1)\\nj.party()\\ns.party()\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/party5.py\\nThe constructor has both a self parameter that points to the object instance\\nand additional parameters that are passed into the constructor as the object is\\nconstructed:\\ns = PartyAnimal(/quotesingle.ts1Sally/quotesingle.ts1)'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 188, 'page_label': '183'}, page_content='14.10. INHERIT ANCE 177\\nWithin the constructor, the second line copies the parameter ( nam) that is passed\\ninto the name attribute within the object instance.\\nself.name = nam\\nThe output of the program shows that each of the objects ( s and j) contain their\\nown independent copies of x and nam:\\nSally constructed\\nSally party count 1\\nJim constructed\\nJim party count 1\\nSally party count 2\\n14.10 Inheritance\\nAnother powerful feature of object-oriented programming is the ability to creat e\\na new class by extending an existing class. When extending a class, we call the\\noriginal class theparent class and the new class the child class .\\nF or this example, we move our PartyAnimal class into its own ﬁle. Then, we can\\n‘import’ the PartyAnimal class in a new ﬁle and extend it, as follows:\\nfrom party import PartyAnimal\\nclass CricketFan(PartyAnimal):\\ndef __init__(self, nam) :\\nsuper().__init__(nam)\\nself.points = 0\\ndef six(self):\\nself.points = self.points + 6\\nself.party()\\nprint(self.name,\"points\",self.points)\\ns = PartyAnimal(\"Sally\")\\ns.party()\\nj\\n= CricketFan(\"Jim\")\\nj.party()\\nj.six()\\nprint(dir(j))\\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/party6.py\\nWhen we deﬁne the CricketFan class, we indicate that we are extending the\\nPartyAnimal class. This means that all of the variables ( x) and methods ( party)\\nfrom the PartyAnimal class are inherited by the CricketFan class. F or example,'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 189, 'page_label': '184'}, page_content='178 CHAPTER 14. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING\\nwithin the six method in the CricketFan class, we call the party method from\\nthe PartyAnimal class.\\nW e use a special syntax in the __init__() method in the CricketFan class to\\ninsure that we call the __init()__ method in the PartyAnimal so that whatever\\nsetup that PartyAnimal needs is done in addition to the setup needed for the\\nCriocketFan extensions.\\ndef __init__(self, nam) :\\nsuper().__init__(nam)\\nself.points = 0\\nThe super() syntax is telling Python to call the __init__ method in the class\\nthat we are extending. PartyAnimal is the super (or parent) class and CricketFan\\nis the sub (or child) class.\\nAs the program executes, we create s and j as independent instances of\\nPartyAnimal and CricketFan.

When Python creates the list object,\\nit calls the constructor method (named __init__) to set up the internal data at-\\ntributes that will be used to store the list data. W e have not passed any param eters\\nto the constructor. When the constructor returns, we use the variable stuff to\\npoint to the returned instance of the list class.\\nThe second and third lines call the append method with one parameter to add a\\nnew item at the end of the list by updating the attributes within stuff. Then\\nin the fourth line, we call the sort method with no parameters to sort the data\\nwithin the stuff object.\\nW e then print out the ﬁrst item in the list using the square brackets which are a\\nshortcut to calling the __getitem__ method within the stuff. This is equivalent\\nto calling the __getitem__ method in the list class and passing the stuff object\\nas the ﬁrst parameter and the position we are looking for as the second paramet er.\\nAt the end of the program, the stuff object is discarded but not before calling\\nthe destructor (named __del__) so that the object can clean up any loose ends as\\nnecessary .\\nThose are the basics of object-oriented programming.

Most databases are organized\\nlike a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest\\ndiﬀerence is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists\\nafter the program ends. Because a database is stored on permanent storage, it can\\nstore far more data than a dictionary , which is limited to the size of the memory\\nin the computer.\\nLike a dictionary , database software is designed to keep the inserting and accessing\\nof data very fast, even for large amounts of data. Database software m aintains its\\nperformance by building indexes as data is added to the database to allow the\\ncomputer to jump quickly to a particular entry .\\nThere are many diﬀerent database systems which are used for a wide variety of pur-\\nposes including: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.\\nW e focus on SQLite in this book because it is a very common database and is\\nalready built into Python. SQLite is designed to be embedded into other applica-\\ntions to provide database support within the application. F or example, the Firef ox\\nbrowser also uses the SQLite database internally as do many other products.\\nhttp://sqlite.org/\\nSQLite is well suited to some of the data manipulation problems that we see in\\nInformatics.\\n15.2 Database concepts\\nWhen you ﬁrst look at a database it looks like a spreadsheet with multiple sheets .\\nThe primary data structures in a database are: tables, rows, and columns.\\nIn technical descriptions of relational databases the concepts of table, row, and\\ncolumn are more formally referred to asrelation, tuple, and attribute, respectively .\\nW e will use the less formal terms in this chapter.\\n181'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 193, 'page_label': '188'}, page_content='182 CHAPTER 15.

When you want to do one or very few operations on a text ﬁle, you can just\\nopen it in a text editor and make the changes you want. When you have many\\nchanges that you need to do to a text ﬁle, often you will write a simple Python\\nprogram. Y ou will ﬁnd the same pattern when working with databases. Y ou will\\ndo simple operations in the database manager and more complex operations will\\nbe most conveniently done in Python.\\n15.4 Creating a database table\\nDatabases require more deﬁned structure than Python lists or dictionaries\\n1 .\\nWhen we create a database table we must tell the database in advance the names\\nof each of the columns in the table and the type of data which we are planning to\\nstore in each column. When the database software knows the type of data in each\\ncolumn, it can choose the most eﬃcient way to store and look up the data based\\non the type of data.\\nY ou can look at the various data types supported by SQLite at the following ur l:\\nhttp://www.sqlite.org/datatypes.html\\nDeﬁning structure for your data up front may seem inconvenient at the beginning,\\nbut the payoﬀ is fast access to your data even when the database contains a large\\namount of data.\\n1 SQLite actually does allow some ﬂexibility in the type of dat a stored in a column, but we\\nwill keep our data types strict in this chapter so the concept s apply equally to other database\\nsystems such as MySQL.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 194, 'page_label': '189'}, page_content='15.4.

Calling cursor() is very similar conceptually to calling\\nopen() when dealing with text ﬁles.\\nOnce we have the cursor, we can begin to execute commands on the contents of\\nthe database using theexecute() method.\\nDatabase commands are expressed in a special language that has been standardized\\nacross many diﬀerent database vendors to allow us to learn a single database\\nlanguage. The database language is calledStructured Query Language or SQL for\\nshort.\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL\\nIn our example, we are executing two SQL commands in our database.

After we\\nexecute the SELECT statement, the cursor is something we can loop through in a\\nfor statement.

The DELETE\\ncommand shows the use of a WHERE clause that allows us to express a selection\\ncriterion so that we can ask the database to apply the command to only the rows\\nthat match the criterion.

USING DA T ABASES AND SQL\\nA relational database is made up of tables, rows, and columns. The columns\\ngenerally have a type such as text, numeric, or date data. When we create a table,\\nwe indicate the names and types of the columns:\\nCREATE TABLE Track (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)\\nT o insert a row into a table, we use the SQL INSERT command:\\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays) VALUES (/quotesingle.ts1My Way/quotesingle.ts1, 15)\\nThe INSERT statement speciﬁes the table name, then a list of the ﬁelds/columns\\nthat you would like to set in the new row, and then the keyword VALUES and a list\\nof corresponding values for each of the ﬁelds.\\nThe SQL SELECT command is used to retrieve rows and columns from a database.\\nThe SELECT statement lets you specify which columns you would like to retrieve\\nas well as a WHERE clause to select which rows you would like to see. It also allows\\nan optional ORDER BY clause to control the sorting of the returned rows.\\nSELECT * FROM Track WHERE title = /quotesingle.ts1My Way/quotesingle.ts1\\nUsing * indicates that you want the database to return all of the columns for each\\nrow that matches the WHERE clause.\\nNote, unlike in Python, in a SQL WHERE clause we use a single equal sign to indicate\\na test for equality rather than a double equal sign. Other logical operations allo wed\\nin a WHERE clause include <, >, <=, >=, !=, as well as AND and OR and parentheses\\nto build your logical expressions.\\nY ou can request that the returned rows be sorted by one of the ﬁelds as follows:\\nSELECT title,plays FROM Track ORDER BY title\\nIt is possible to UPDATE a column or columns within one or more rows in a table\\nusing the SQL UPDATE statement as follows:\\nUPDATE Track SET plays = 16 WHERE title = /quotesingle.ts1My Way/quotesingle.ts1\\nThe UPDATE statement speciﬁes a table and then a list of ﬁelds and values to change\\nafter the SET keyword and then an optional WHERE clause to select the rows that\\nare to be updated. A single UPDATE statement will change all of the rows that\\nmatch the WHERE clause. If a WHERE clause is not speciﬁed, it performs the UPDATE\\non all of the rows in the table.\\nT o remove a row, you need a WHERE clause on an SQL DELETE statement. The\\nWHERE clause determines which rows are to be deleted:\\nDELETE FROM Track WHERE title = /quotesingle.ts1My Way/quotesingle.ts1'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 198, 'page_label': '193'}, page_content='15.6. MUL TIPLE T ABLES AND BASIC DA T A MODELING 187\\nThese four basic SQL commands (INSER T, SELECT, UPDA TE, and DELETE) al-\\nlow the four basic operations needed to create and maintain data. W e use “CRUD”\\n(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) to capture all these concepts in a single term. 2\\n15.6 Multiple tables and basic data modeling\\nThe real power of a relational database is when we create multiple tables and mak e\\nlinks between those tables. The act of deciding how to break up your application\\ndata into multiple tables and establishing the relationships between the tables\\nis calleddata modeling . The design document that shows the tables and their\\nrelationships is called a data model .\\nData modeling is a relatively sophisticated skill and we will only introduce the\\nmost basic concepts of relational data modeling in this section. F or more detail o n\\ndata modeling you can start with:\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model\\nLets say for our tracks database we wanted to track the name of the artist for\\neach track in addition to the title and number of plays for each track. A simple\\napproach might be to simply add another column to the database called artist\\nand put the name of the artist in the column as follows:\\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Track\\n;\\nCREATE TABLE Track (title TEXT, plays INTEGER, artist TEXT) ;\\nThen we could insert a few tracks into our table.\\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays, artist)\\nVALUES (/quotesingle.ts1My Way/quotesingle.ts1, 15, /quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1);\\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays, artist)\\nVALUES (/quotesingle.ts1New York/quotesingle.ts1, 25, /quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1);\\nIf we were to look at our data with a SELECT * FROM Track statement, it looks\\nlike we have done a ﬁne job.\\nsqlite> SELECT * FROM Track;\\nMy Way|15|Frank Sinatra\\nNew York|25|Frank Sinatra\\nsqlite>\\nW e have made a very bad error in our data modeling. W e have violated the rules\\nof database normalization .\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization\\n2Y es there is a disconnect between “CRUD” term and the ﬁrst let ters of the four SQL state-\\nments that implement “CRUD” . A possible explanation might b e to claim that “CRUD” is the\\n“concept” and SQL is the implementation. Another possible e xplanation is that “CRUD” is more\\nfun to say than “ISUD” .'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 199, 'page_label': '194'}, page_content='188 CHAPTER 15. USING DA T ABASES AND SQL\\nWhile database normalization seems very complex on the surface and contains a\\nlot of mathematical justiﬁcations, for now we can reduce it all into one simple rule\\nthat we will follow.\\nW e should never put the same string data in a column more than once. If we\\nneed the data more than once, we create a numeric key for the data and reference\\nthe actual data using this key . Especially if the multiple entries refer to the sam e\\nobject.\\nT o demonstrate the slippery slope we are going down by assigning string col umns\\nto out database model, think about how we would change the data model if we\\nwanted to keep track of the eye color of our artists? W ould we do this?\\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Track;\\nCREATE TABLE Track (title TEXT, plays INTEGER,\\nartist TEXT, eyes TEXT);\\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays, artist, eyes)\\nVALUES (/quotesingle.ts1My Way/quotesingle.ts1, 15, /quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1Blue/quotesingle.ts1);\\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays, artist, eyes)\\nVALUES (/quotesingle.ts1New York/quotesingle.ts1, 25, /quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1Blue/quotesingle.ts1);\\nSince F rank Sinatra recorded over 1200 songs, are we really going to put the string\\n‘Blue’ in 1200 rows in our Track table. And what would happen if we decided his\\neye color was ‘Light Blue’? Something just does not feel right.\\nThe correct solution is to create a table for the each Artist and store all the data\\nabout the artist in that table. And then somehow we need to make a connection\\nbetween a row in theTrack table to a row in the Artist table. Perhaps we could\\ncall this “link” between two “tables” a “relationship” between two tables. And\\nthat is exactly what database experts decided to all these links.\\nLets make anArtist table as follows:\\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Artist;\\nCREATE TABLE Artist (name TEXT, eyes TEXT);\\nINSERT INTO Artist (name, eyes)\\nVALUES (/quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1blue/quotesingle.ts1);\\nNow we have two tables but we need a way to link rows in the two tables. T o do\\nthis, we need what we call ‘keys’ . These keys will just be integer numbers that\\nwe can use to lookup a row in diﬀerent table. If we are going to make links to\\nrows inside of a table, we need to add a primary key to the rows in the table. By\\nconvention we usually name the primary key column ‘id’ . So our Artist table\\nlooks as follows:\\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Artist;\\nCREATE TABLE Artist ( id INTEGER, name TEXT, eyes TEXT);\\nINSERT INTO Artist ( id, name, eyes)\\nVALUES (42, /quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1blue/quotesingle.ts1);\\nNow we have a row in the table for ‘F rank Sinatra’ (and his eye color) and a\\nprimary key of ‘42’ to use to link our tracks to him. So we alter our T rack table\\nas follows:'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 200, 'page_label': '195'}, page_content='15.7. DA T A MODEL DIAGRAMS 189\\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Track;\\nCREATE TABLE Track (title TEXT, plays INTEGER,\\nartist_id INTEGER);\\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays, artist_id)\\nVALUES (/quotesingle.ts1My Way/quotesingle.ts1, 15, 42);\\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays, artist_id)\\nVALUES (/quotesingle.ts1New York/quotesingle.ts1, 25, 42);\\nThe artist_id column is an integer, and by naming convention is a foreign key\\npointing at a primary key in the Artist table. W e call it a foreign key because it\\nis pointing to a row in a diﬀerent table.\\nNow we are following the rules of database normalization, but when we want to\\nget data out of our database, we don’t want to see the 42, we want to see the name\\nand eye color of the artist. T o do this we use theJOIN keyword in our SELECT\\nstatement.\\nSELECT title, plays, name, eyes\\nFROM Track JOIN Artist\\nON Track.artist_id = Artist.id;\\nThe JOIN clause includes an ON condition that deﬁnes how the rows are to to be\\nconnected. F or each row in Track add the data from Artist from the row where\\nartist_id Track table matches the id from the Artist table.\\nThe output would be:\\nMy Way|15|Frank Sinatra|blue\\nNew York|25|Frank Sinatra|blue\\nWhile it might seem a little clunky and your instincts might tell you that it w ould\\nbe faster just to keep the data in one table, it turns out the the limit on database\\nperformance is how much data needs to be scanned when retrieving a query . While\\nthe details are very complex, integers are a lot smaller than strings (especially\\nUnicode) and far quicker to to move and compare.\\n15.7 Data model diagrams\\nWhile our Track and Artist database design is simple with just two tables and\\na single one-to-many relationship, these data models can get complicated quickly\\nand are easier to understand if we can make a graphical representation of our data\\nmodel.\\nWhile there are many graphical representations of data models, we will use one o f\\nthe “classic” approaches, called “Crow’s F oot Diagrams” as shown in Fig ure\\n15.4.\\nEach table is shown as a box with the name of the table and its columns. Then\\nwhere there is a relationship between two tables a line is drawn connecting the\\ntables with a notation added to the end of each line indicating the nature of the\\nrelationship.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 201, 'page_label': '196'}, page_content='190 CHAPTER 15.

So the tr ack end\\nis shown with the crow’s foot spread out indicating it is the\" “many” end. The\\nartist end is shown with a vertical like that indicates “one” . There will be “many”\\nartists in general, but the important aspect is that for each artist there w ill be\\nmany tracks. And each of those artists may be associated with multipl e tracks.\\nY ou will note that the column that holds the foreign_key like artist_id is on the\\n“many” end and the primary key is at the “one” end.\\nSince the pattern of foreign and primary key placement is so consistent and follow s\\nthe “many” and “one” ends of the lines, we never include either the primary or\\nforeign key columns in our diagram of the data model as shown in the second\\ndiagram as shown in Figure\\n15.5. The columns are thought of as “implementation\\ndetail” to capture the nature of the relationship details and not an essential part\\nof the data being modeled.\\n15.8 Automatically creating primary keys\\nIn the above example, we arbitrarily assigned F rank the primary key of 42.However\\nwhen we are inserting millions or rows, it is nice to have the database automa tically\\ngenerate the values for the id column. W e do this by declaring the id column as\\na PRIMARY KEY and leave out the id value when inserting the row:\\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Artist;\\nCREATE TABLE Artist ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ,\\nname TEXT, eyes TEXT);\\nINSERT INTO Artist (name, eyes)\\nVALUES (/quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1blue/quotesingle.ts1);\\nNow we have instructed the database to auto-assign us a unique value to the F rank\\nSinatra row. But we then need a way to have the database tell us theid value for\\nthe recently inserted row. One way is to use a SELECT statement to retrieve data\\nfrom an SQLite built-in-fuction called last_insert_rowid().'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 202, 'page_label': '197'}, page_content='15.9.

USING DA T ABASES AND SQL\\nSince we have two tables and a foreign key between the two tables, our data is\\nwell-modeled, but if we are going to have millions of records in the Artist table\\nand going to do a lot of lookups by artist name, we would beneﬁt if we gave the\\ndatabase a hint about our intended use of thename column.\\nW e do this by adding an “index” to a text column that we intend to use in WHERE\\nclauses:\\nCREATE INDEX artist_name ON Artist(name);\\nWhen the database has been told that an index is needed on a column in a table, it\\nstores extra information to make it possible to look up a row more qui ckly using the\\nindexed ﬁeld ( name in this example). Once you request that an index be created,\\nthere is nothing special that is needed in the SQL to access the table. The database\\nkeeps the index up to date as data is inserted, deleted, and updated, and uses it\\nautomatically if it will increase the performance of a database query .\\nThese text columns that are used to ﬁnd rows based on some information in the\\n“real world” like the name of an artist are called Logical keys .\\n15.10 Adding constraints to the data database\\nW e can also use an index to enforce a constraint (i.e. rules) on our database op-\\nerations. The most common constraint is a uniqueness constraint which insists\\nthat all of the values in a column are unique. W e can add the optional UNIQUE\\nkeyword, to the CREATE INDEX statement to tell the database that we would like it\\nto enforce the constraint on our SQL. W e can drop and re-create the artist_name\\nindex with a UNIQUE constraint as follows.\\nDROP INDEX artist_name;\\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX artist_name ON Artist(name);\\nIf we try to insert ‘F rank Sinatra’ a second time, it will fail with an error.\\nsqlite> SELECT * FROM Artist;\\n1|Frank Sinatra|blue\\nsqlite> INSERT INTO Artist (name, eyes)\\n...> VALUES (/quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1blue/quotesingle.ts1);\\nRuntime error: UNIQUE constraint failed: Artist.name (19)\\nsqlite>\\nW e can tell the database to ignore any duplicate key errors by adding the IGNORE\\nkeyword to the INSERT statement as follows:\\nsqlite> INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Artist (name, eyes)\\n...> VALUES (/quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1blue/quotesingle.ts1);\\nsqlite> SELECT id FROM Artist WHERE name=/quotesingle.ts1Frank Sinatra/quotesingle.ts1;\\n1\\nsqlite>'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 204, 'page_label': '199'}, page_content='15.11.

There will be courses, users, and rosters. A user can be on the roster for\\nmany courses and a course will have many users on its roster.\\nIt is pretty simple todraw a many-to-many relationship as shown in Figure\\n15.7.\\nW e simply draw two tables and connect them with a line that has the “many” indi-\\ncator on both ends of the lines. The problem is how to implement the relationship\\nusing primary keys and foreign keys.\\nBefore we explore how we implement many-to-many relationships, let’s see if we\\ncould hack something up by extending a one-to many relationship.\\nIf SQL supported the notion of arrays, we might try to deﬁne this:\\nCREATE TABLE Course (\\nid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ,\\ntitle TEXT UNIQUE\\nstudent_ids ARRAY OF INTEGER;\\n);'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 208, 'page_label': '203'}, page_content='15.12.

The purpose of this table is to\\ncapture the connection between a course and a student.\\nIn a sense the table sits between the Course and User table and has a one-to-many\\nrelationship to both tables. By using an intermediate table we break a many-t o-\\nmany relationship into two one-to-many relationships. Databases are very g ood at\\nmodeling and processing one-to-many relationships.\\nAn example Member table would be as follows:\\nCREATE TABLE User (\\nid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ,\\nname TEXT UNIQUE\\n);\\nCREATE TABLE Course (\\nid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ,\\ntitle TEXT UNIQUE\\n);\\nCREATE TABLE Member (\\n3 Some SQL dialects support arrays but arrays do not scale well .

It\\nis quite common to want to add some data to the connection itself.\\nContinuing with our example of users, courses, and rosters to model a simple\\nlearning management system, we will also need to understand therole that each\\nuser is assigned in each course.\\nIf we ﬁrst try to solve this by adding an “instructor” ﬂag to theUser table, we\\nwill ﬁnd that this does not work because a user can be a instructor in one course\\nand a student in another course. If we add an instructor_id to the Course table\\nit will not work because a course can have multiple instructors. And there is no\\none-to-many hack that can deal with the fact that the number of roles will expand\\ninto roles like T eaching Assistant or Parent.\\nBut if we simply add arole column to the Member table - we can represent a wide\\nrange of roles, role combinations, etc.\\nLets change our member table as follows:\\nDROP TABLE Member ;\\nCREATE TABLE Member (\\nuser_id INTEGER,\\ncourse_id INTEGER,\\nrole INTEGER,\\nPRIMARY KEY (user_id, course_id)\\n);\\nF or simplicity , we will decide that zero in the role means “student” and one in the\\nrolemeans instructor.

It is more complicated to write the code to use a\\ndatabase to store data than Python dictionaries or ﬂat ﬁles so there is littlereason\\nto use a database unless your application truly needs the capabilities of a database.\\nThe situations where a database can be quite useful are: (1) when your application\\nneeds to make many small random updates within a large data set, (2) when your\\ndata is so large it cannot ﬁt in a dictionary and you need to look up information\\nrepeatedly , or (3) when you have a long-running process that you want to be able\\nto stop and restart and retain the data from one run to the next.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 213, 'page_label': '208'}, page_content='202 CHAPTER 15. USING DA T ABASES AND SQL\\nY ou can build a simple database with a single table to suit many application needs,\\nbut most problems will require several tables and links/relationships between row s\\nin diﬀerent tables. When you start making links between tables, it is importa nt to\\ndo some thoughtful design and follow the rules of database normalization to m ake\\nthe best use of the database’s capabilities. Since the primary motivation for us ing\\na database is that you have a large amount of data to deal with, it is impor tant to\\nmodel your data eﬃciently so your programs run as fast as possible.\\n15.15 Debugging\\nOne common pattern when you are developing a Python program to connect to\\nan SQLite database will be to run a Python program and check the results using\\nthe Database Browser for SQLite. The browser allows you to quickly check tosee\\nif your program is working properly .\\nY ou must be careful because SQLite takes care to keep two programs from changing\\nthe same data at the same time. F or example, if you open a database in the brow ser\\nand make a change to the database and have not yet pressed the “save” button\\nin the browser, the browser “locks” the database ﬁle and keeps any other program\\nfrom accessing the ﬁle. In particular, your Python program will not be able to\\naccess the ﬁle if it is locked.\\nSo a solution is to make sure to either close the database browser or use the\\nFile menu to close the database in the browser before you attempt to access the\\ndatabase from Python to avoid the problem of your Python code failing because\\nthe database is locked.\\n15.16 Glossary\\nattributeOne of the values within a tuple.

The gmane service was very\\npopular with open source projects because it provided a nice searchable archive of\\ntheir email activity .\\nhttp://mbox.dr-chuck.net/export.php\\nWhen the Sakai email data was spidered using this software, it produced nearly a\\nGigabyte of data and took a number of runs on several days. The ﬁle README.txt\\nin the above ZIP may have instructions as to how you can download a pre-spidered\\ncopy of thecontent.sqlite ﬁle for a majority of the Sakai email corpus so you don’t\\nhave to spider for ﬁve days just to run the programs. If you download the pre-\\nspidered content, you should still run the spidering process to catch up with more\\nrecent messages.\\nThe ﬁrst step is to spider the repository . The base URL is hard-coded in the\\ngmane.py and is hard-coded to the Sakai developer list. Y ou can spider another\\nrepository by changing that base url. Make sure to delete the content.sqlite ﬁle if\\nyou switch the base url.\\nThe gmane.py ﬁle operates as a responsible caching spider in that it runs slowly\\nand retrieves one mail message per second so as to avoid getting throttled.

Perhaps administrators can delete\\nmessages or perhaps they get lost. If your spider stops, and it seems it has hit\\na missing message, go into the SQLite Manager and add a row with the missing\\nid leaving all the other ﬁelds blank and restartgmane.py. This will unstick the\\nspidering process and allow it to continue. These empty messages will be ignored\\nin the next phase of the process.\\nOne nice thing is that once you have spidered all of the messages and have them\\nincontent.sqlite, you can run gmane.py again to get new messages as they are sent\\nto the list.\\nThe content.sqlite data is pretty raw, with an ineﬃcient data model, and not\\ncompressed. This is intentional as it allows you to look at content.sqlite in the\\nSQLite Manager to debug problems with the spidering process. It would be a bad\\nidea to run any queries against this database, as they would be quite slow.\\nThe second process is to run the program gmodel.py. This program reads the raw\\ndata from content.sqlite and produces a cleaned-up and well-modeled version of\\nthe data in the ﬁle index.sqlite. This ﬁle will be much smaller (often 10X smaller)\\nthan content.sqlite because it also compresses the header and body text.\\nEach time gmodel.py runs it deletes and rebuilds index.sqlite, allowing you to adjust\\nits parameters and edit the mapping tables in content.sqlite to tweak the data\\ncleaning process. This is a sample run of gmodel.py. It prints a line out each time\\n250 mail messages are processed so you can see some progress happening, as this\\nprogram may run for a while processing nearly a Gigabyte of mail data.\\nLoaded allsenders 1588 and mapping 28 dns mapping 1\\n1 2005-12-08T23:34:30-06:00 ggolden22@mac.com\\n251 2005-12-22T10:03:20-08:00 tpamsler@ucdavis.edu\\n501 2006-01-12T11:17:34-05:00 lance@indiana.edu\\n751 2006-01-24T11:13:28-08:00 vrajgopalan@ucmerced.edu\\n...'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 224, 'page_label': '219'}, page_content='16.3.

Other\\ndomain names are truncated to three levels. So si.umich.edu becomes umich.edu\\nand caret.cam.ac.uk becomes cam.ac.uk. Email addresses are also forced to lower\\ncase, and some of the @gmane.org address like the following\\narwhyte-63aXycvo3TyHXe+LvDLADg@public.gmane.org\\nare converted to the real address whenever there is a matching real email address\\nelsewhere in the message corpus.\\nIn themapping.sqlite database there are two tables that allow you to map both\\ndomain names and individual email addresses that change over the lifetime of the\\nemail list. F or example, Steve Githens used the following email addresses as he\\nchanged jobs over the life of the Sakai developer list:\\ns-githens@northwestern.edu\\nsgithens@cam.ac.uk\\nswgithen@mtu.edu\\nW e can add two entries to the Mapping table in mapping.sqlite so gmodel.py will\\nmap all three to one address:\\ns-githens@northwestern.edu -> swgithen@mtu.edu\\nsgithens@cam.ac.uk -> swgithen@mtu.edu\\nY ou can also make similar entries in the DNSMapping table if there are multi ple\\nDNS names you want mapped to a single DNS. The following mapping was added\\nto the Sakai data:\\niupui.edu -> indiana.edu\\nso all the accounts from the various Indiana University campuses are tracked to-\\ngether.\\nY ou can rerun the gmodel.py over and over as you look at the data, and add\\nmappings to make the data cleaner and cleaner.

Downey)\\nIn January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in\\nJava. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure ra te in\\nthe class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of\\nachievement was too low.\\nOne of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much\\nunnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to\\nprogram. And they all suﬀered from the trap door eﬀect: they would start out\\neasy , proceed gradually , and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would\\nfall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would\\nspend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.\\nT wo weeks before the ﬁrst day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My\\ngoals were:\\n• Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50\\npages.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 230, 'page_label': '225'}, page_content='A.4. PREF ACE FOR “THINK PYTHON” 219\\n• Be careful with vocabulary . I tried to minimize the jargon and deﬁne each\\nterm at ﬁrst use.\\n• Build gradually . T o avoid trap doors, I took the most diﬃcult topics and\\nsplit them into a series of small steps.\\n• F ocus on programming, not the programming language. I included the min-\\nimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.\\nI needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist .\\nMy ﬁrst version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they\\nunderstood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting\\ntopics and (most important) letting the students practice.\\nI released the book under the GNU F ree Documentation License, which allows\\nusers to copy , modify , and distribute the book.\\nWhat happened next is the cool part. Jeﬀ Elkner, a high school teacher in Vir-\\nginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his\\ntranslation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my\\nown book.\\nJeﬀ and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by Chris Meyers, and in 200 1\\nwe released How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python , also\\nunder the GNU F ree Documentation License. As Green T ea Press, I published the\\nbook and started selling hard copies through Amazon.com and college book stores.\\nOther books from Green T ea Press are available at\\ngreenteapress.com.\\nIn 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the ﬁrst\\ntime. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more,\\nworked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.\\nOver the last ﬁve years I have continued to develop the book, correcting errors,\\nimproving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises. In 2008\\nI started work on a major revision—at the same time, I was contacted by an editor\\nat Cambridge University Press who was interested in publishing the next edition.\\nGood timing!\\nI hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program\\nand think, at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.\\nA.4.2 Acknowledgements for “Think Python”\\n(Allen B. Downey)\\nFirst and most importantly , I thank Jeﬀ Elkner, who translated my Java b ook into\\nPython, which got this project started and introduced me to what has turned out\\nto be my favorite language.\\nI also thank Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections toHow to Think Like\\na Computer Scientist .\\nAnd I thank the F ree Software F oundation for developing the GNU F ree Documen-\\ntation License, which helped make my collaboration with Jeﬀ and Chris poss ible.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/pdf/pythonlearn.pdf', 'page': 231, 'page_label': '226'}, page_content='220 APPENDIX A.
